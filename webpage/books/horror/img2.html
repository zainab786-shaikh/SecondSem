            <b>ABOUT:</b>
            An outcast at his high school, Dan is excited to finally make some friends in his last summer before
            college.
            But when he arrives at the program, Dan learns that his dorm for the summer used to be a sanatorium, more
            commonly
            known as an asylum. And not just any asylumâ€”a last resort for the criminally insane.<br><br>
            Asylum series has sold million of copies world-wide.<br><br>
            <b>SUMMARY:</b> Asylum is a gripping story about Daniel Crawford who attends a summer pre-college programme.
            The students taking part in the programme are told that the student accommodation is being refurbished and
            they
            will be staying in the old asylum on the campus. When he moves into his dormitory he finds a picture of a
            doctor
            with his eyes scribbled over. Dan's roommate, Felix, tells him there are more photos in the old west wing.
            Dan
            investigates the office with his new friends Abby and Jordan; they discover more photos of the asylum which
            leads to
            Dan discovering his real family, Abby's lost aunt, and uncovering the truth about someone

                from

                everyone spoke of. I highly recommend
                this book if you want your mind to be twisted and turned in ways you can't imagine. Creepy,
                terrifying,
                horrid, and downright scary!
                Loved it</td>

                I
                finished this treasure in one night.
                Bird Box is such an original premise and is written so very well, its author creates a world of
                people
                driven mad by what they see, so
                seeing itself becomes forbidden. I don't usually read horror, but I am glad I made an exception for
                this
                gift box. <br></td>
