        <b>Author:</b><i> Shirley Jackson</i><br>
        <b>Date of publish:</b><i> October 16, 1959</i><br><br>
        <b>ABOUT:</b> The Haunting of Hill House is a 1959 gothic horror novel by American author Shirley Jackson. A
        finalist for the National
        Book Award and considered one of the best literary ghost stories published during the 20th century, it has been
        made into two feature films
        and a play, and is the basis of a Netflix series.<br><br>
        <b>SUMMARY:</b> It is the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly pile called Hill House:
        Dr. Montague, an occult scholar
        looking for solid evidence of a "haunting"; Theodora, the lighthearted assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile
        young woman well acquainted
        with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a
        spooky encounter with inexplicable
        phenomena. But Hill House is gathering its powersâ€”and soon it will choose one of them to make its own.

                writing style is good and oddly
                humorous but the story itself is quite vague and the book will bore you at times . It does not really
                have any scares that you expect from a good(any) horror book either</td>

            <td><b>Pranjal</b><br>Seriously??? Waste of time. It was boring, draggie, slow, senseless, meaningless and
                has absolutely zero scare quotient.
                Supernatural? Horror? I truly am speechless. I was expecting a horror novel and what I got was just some
                senseless story about a gathering
                of 4 people without much point to the story. I am sorry I sound so angry but I really wasted time and
                money on this book.<br></td>
