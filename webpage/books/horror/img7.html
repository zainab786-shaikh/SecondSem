            <b>SUMMARY:</b> "There are a few authors that do manage to get in my head enough with their work. This gal's
            book has done PRECISELY that.
            I had nightmares for two nights straight!" - Amazon ReviewerHow do you explain something that you can't
            prove or
            touch? You know without a doubt
            that something is there, lurking in the corner, watching your every move yet invisible to the naked eye,
            Your
            heart thuds and pounds against your ribs.
            Your fear spikes so high that your stomach twists and turns, and your pores prick with chill before layering
            your skin with a fine sheen of sweat.And when
            you sleep .you can feel them, smell them, see them, but no one else can. It haunts you in the night, holding
            you
            prisoner to your bed, tormenting you with
            an unrelenting terror. You're paralyzed and helpless, unable to scream, unable to think rationally . unable
            to
            move.Is this the trick of the mind, or is
            Victoria truly plagued with REAL demons?Based on a true story, it's the stuff of nightmares literally.This
            is
            part one, two, and three of the Night of
            Terror series. Reader discretion advised.
