        <b>ABOUT:</b> Harshita Bharti is thirteen years old and started writing when she was eleven. She started writing
        this book a year ago. She is deeply concerned about anybody who has mental illness as well as people in any kind
        of
        pain because it does not take time for the pain to turn into something else. An ambivert by nature, she is
        passionate
        about writing.<br><br>
        <b>SUMMARY:</b>How can you go on every day trying to hide yourself? How long do you think people will consider
        mental illness as nothing but craziness?
        Do you think it is safe to say that the little girl Sarah will make it out alive?<br>
        “Please do me and yourself a kind favour:<br>
        REDEEM yourself.<br>
        REALISE your worth.<br>
        RELEASE your soul.”<br>
