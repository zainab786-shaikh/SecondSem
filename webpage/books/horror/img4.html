            <b>ABOUT:</b>"Hell House is the scariest haunted house novel ever written. It looms over the rest the way the mountains loom over the 
            foothills." -- Stephen KingRolf Rudolph Deutsch is going die. But when Deutsch, a wealthy magazine and newpaper publisher, starts thinking 
            seriously about his impending death, he offers to pay a physicist and two mediums, one physical and one mental, $100,000 each to establish 
            the facts of life after death.Dr. Lionel Barrett, the physicist, accompanied by the mediums, travel to the Belasco House in Maine, which has
                been abandoned and sealed since 1949 after a decade of drug addiction, alcoholism, and debauchery. For one night, Barrett and his colleagues 
                investigate the Belasco House and learn exactly why the townfolks refer to it as the Hell House.<br><br>
                Hell house is the scariest novel ever written<br><br>
            <b>SUMMARY:</b> For over 20 years, Belasco House has stood empty. Regarded as the Mt. Everest of haunted houses, its shadowed walls have witnessed
                scenes of unimaginable horror and depravity. All previous attempts to probe its mysteries have ended in murder, suicide, or insanity.  But now, a new 
                investigation has been launched, bringing four strangers to Belasco House in search of the ultimate secrets of life and death. A wealthy publisher, 
                brooding over his impending death, has paid a physicist and two mediums to establish the facts of life after death once and for all. For one night, 
                they will investigate the Belasco House and learn exactly why the townsfolk refer to it as the Hell House.<br>
            Hell House, which inspired the 1973 film The Legend of Hell House, is Matheson's most frightening and shocking book, 
            and an acknowledged classic of the genre.
