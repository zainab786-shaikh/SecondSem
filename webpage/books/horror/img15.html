        <b>ABOUT:</b>
        "When the Devil Whispers" is broadly inspired by true events of arguably India's most horrific crime ever
        committed by a group of women who
        became the first Indian women sentenced to be hanged to death. Sushant Divgikar articulated, "Petrifying, that
        was the feeling throughout the
        book. <br><br>
        <b>SUMMARY:</b> the book is based on true events and real men and women who abducted and used and murdered
        little children for little profit and
        with no remorse and no guilt. The case made the history as it resulted into murder penalties after a very long
        time in India. There really are some
        crimes which are unforgivable and some criminals are beyond any psychological justifications, almost wanting you
        to believe in existence of the Devil
        to have inspired such heinous acts.<br>
        As the author says at end of the book:<br>
        <i>At times like these, when the world is at a loss and has been stripped of humanity, one may challenge the
            very existence of God. And if one must
            believe in Him, then He might as well be the most insidious force that humans will ever encounter.</i>
