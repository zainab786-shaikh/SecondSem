                ordinary town: familiar, well-ordered for the most part, a good place to live.It is a group of children who see - and feel - what makes Derry 
                so horribly different. In the storm drains, in the sewers, IT lurks, taking on the shape of every nightmare, each one's deepest dread. Sometimes 
                is appears as an evil clown named Pennywise and sometimes IT reaches up, seizing, tearing, killing . . .Time passes and the children grow up, 
                move away and forget. Until they are called back, once more to confront IT as IT stirs and coils in the sullen depths of their memories, 
                emerging again to make their past nightmares a terrible present reality.

                        children would think and make us feel their fears. It was really long with a lot of descriptions but it was still very enjoyable.</td>
