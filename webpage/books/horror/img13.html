        <b>ABOUT:</b> In Adam Nevill's The Ritual, four old university friends reunite for a hiking trip in the
        Scandinavian wilderness of the Arctic
        Circle. No longer young men, they have little left in common and tensions rise as they struggle to
        connect.<br><br>
        <b>SUMMARY:</b> When four old University friends set off into the Scandinavian wilderness of the Arctic Circle,
        they aim to briefly escape the
        problems of their lives and reconnect with one another. But when Luke, the only man still single and living a
        precarious existence, finds he has
        little left in common with his well-heeled friends, tensions rise. With limited experience between them, a
        shortcut meant to ease their hike turns
        into a nightmare scenario that could cost them their lives. Lost, hungry, and surrounded by forest untouched for
        millennia, Luke figures things couldn't
        possibly get any worse.<br>
        But then they stumble across an old habitation. Ancient artifacts decorate the walls and there are bones
        scattered upon the dry floors.
        The residue of old rites and pagan sacrifice for something that still exists in the forest. Something
        responsible for the bestial presence
        that follows their every step. As the four friends stagger in the direction of salvation, they learn that death
        doesn't come easy among these
        ancient trees.
