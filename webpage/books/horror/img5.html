            <b>ABOUT:</b>Along with being a horror book, House of Screams also does justice to the mystery and thriller genres. It is 
            written in simple English, does not deviate from the central theme and is lucid. Everything is mentioned in detail, 
            especially the insides of the bungalow, and the events at the house can be visualized as happening while reading the book.<br><br> 
            <b>SUMMARY:</b> Tired, she soon fell asleep to the sound of Zain's gentle breathing. The crickets outside seemed to have 
            finally gone quiet. An hour later, the screams began.When Muneera finds out she's inherited her uncle's old house on Myrtle 
            Lane, she decides to move in with her husband, Zain, and their three-year-old son, Adnan. The promise of saving money and 
            living in one of Bangalore's nicest areas has them packing up their old lives at their tiny apartment and shifting to this 
            sprawling bungalow. But they soon realize there's more to the house than its old-world charm. Bloody hands reach out of the 
            walls; there's a boy whom only Adnan can see; and every night, they're woken up by loud, blood-curdling screams. As the 
            terrors threaten to tear their little family apart, they discover the shocking extent of the house's gory history. And 
            unless they manage to leave, they're going to become a part of it.

                in simple easy english. The ending to the story was very predictable. It could have ended in a different way rather than the predictable
                    ending in horror stories. The chapters are short and one can read the book in a single sitting.</td>
