            <b>ABOUT:</b> Bird Box is a 2014 post-apocalyptic novel and the debut novel by American writer and singer Josh Malerman. 
            The book was first published in the United Kingdom on March 27, 2014, through Harper Voyager and in the United States on May 13, 
            2014, through Ecco Press.<br><br>
            <b>SUMMARY:</b> something is out there, something terrifying that must not be seen. One glimpse of it, and a person is driven to deadly violence. 
            No one knows what it is or where it came from.<br>
            Five years after it began, a handful of scattered survivors remains, including Malorie and her two young children. Living in an abandoned house 
            near the river, she has dreamed of fleeing to a place where they might be safe. Now that the boy and girl are four, it's time to go, but the 
            journey ahead will be terrifying: twenty miles downriver in a rowboat—blindfolded—with nothing to rely on but her wits and the children's trained
                ears. One wrong choice and they will die. Something is following them all the while, but is it man, animal, or monster?<br>
            Interweaving past and present, Bird Box is a snapshot of a world unraveled that will have you racing to the final page.

                    Bird Box is such an original premise and is written so very well, its author creates a world of people driven mad by what they see, so 
                    seeing itself becomes forbidden. I don't usually read horror, but I am glad I made an exception for this gift box. <br></td>
