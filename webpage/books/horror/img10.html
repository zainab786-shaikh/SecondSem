        <b>ABOUT:</b> “The Exorcist,” the story of a 12-year-old girl possessed by a demon, was published in 1971 and
        sold more than 13 million copies.
        <br><br>
        <b>SUMMARY:</b> Georgetown, Washington D.C. Actress and divorced mother Chris MacNeil starts to experience
        'difficulties' with her usually sweet-natured
        eleven-year-old daughter Regan. The child becomes afflicted by spasms, convulsions and unsettling amnesiac
        episodes; these abruptly worsen into violent fits
        of appalling foul-mouthed curses, accompanied by physical mutation. Medical science is baffled by Regan's plight
        and, in her increasing despair, Chris turns
        to troubled priest and psychiatrist Damien Karras, who immediately recognises something profoundly malevolent in
        Regan's distorted fetures and speech.
        On Karras's recommendation, the Church summons Father Merrin, a specialist in the exorcism of demons.

            <td><b>Fransisca</b><br><br>This is a book that, in my opinion, sets the standard for modern horror. Not
                only is the story disturbing and
                brilliantly written, but it stays with you for long after you've finished the book. Why? Because it all
                seems so normal to begin with.
                All the unnerving things seem to have simple explanations. So, for the longest time, the characters move
                unaware of the horror to come.
                For the reader, this soon becomes a experience where it takes little to start extrapolating this
                semblance of normalcy into everyday life.</td>

                unflinching, this story will inspire
                thought provoking discussions (as well as nightmares)! Fantastically executed drama and mystery, with an
                air of creeping dread, and later
                hope.</td>

                seen the movie.
                If you found the movie scary, the book is more horrifying in lots of different ways that I was
                unprepared for. I think it's
                because your imagination is in overdrive.</td>

            <td><b>Brett</b><br>I really enjoyed this one. It has all the elements of eerie paranormal horror with some
                mystery. The plot involves a
                little girl who's life goes from normal to complete terror. The little girl, Regan, starts playing with
                a ouija board and an unknown
                presence begins communicating with her. The unwanted entity, who goes by the name of Mr. Howdy, slowly
                becomes problematic. As with all
                paranormal activity, the plot tracks the demonic activity commonly seen in the four stages: infestation,
                oppression, obsession, and
                eventual possession of the little girl. The plot is riddled with psychiatric, religious, and
                occult-witchcraft fervor that adds to the
                atmospheric heaviness leading to the exorcism.<br></td>
