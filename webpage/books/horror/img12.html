            <b>ABOUT:</b> The second book in the Sarah Bennett Myseteries, continues to grab your attention from the beginning!
                Author Terry Lynn Thomas continues to mesmerize and grab attention from beginning to end! Sarah has been offered a 
                job by Dr. Matthew Geisler, a psychiatrist and an expert in the occult. Unbeknownst to Sarah, Dr. Geisler is wanting 
                to learn more about Sarah's paranormal abilities, but will she want to reveal her secrets to a stranger? Finding out 
                that Zeke is in the hospital wing of the institute and was behind the job offer almost made Sarah walk away until
                Dr. Geisler mentioned his ability to help her control the spirits voices. But as we all know, things are not always 
                what they seem.<br><br>
            
            <b>SUMMARY</b>: Sarah Bennett has two secrets: she sees ghosts, and she is in love with a spy.
            When Sarah takes a job with occult expert Dr Matthew Geisler, he promises to help her understand
                the sorrowful spirit that seems to have attached itself to her.<br>
                As Sarah struggles to cope with the ghostly presence, she runs into Zeke, the man who left her six 
                months earlier and is recovering from injuries suffered in an alleged accident. But Zeke has secrets
                of his own, and when an attempt is made on Geislerâ€™s life, Sarah finds herself caught in a struggle 
                between the living and the dead.<br>
            Unsure who she can trust, Sarah must solve the mystery of the soul determined to haunt her, and save Dr
                Geisler and herself from an unknown threat.
