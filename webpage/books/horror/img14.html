            <b>ABOUT:</b> The Ruins is a 2006 horror novel by American author Scott Smith, set on Mexico's Yucatan
            Peninsula. The book fits specifically
            into the survival horror genre, which is marked by people doing whatever it takes to conquer their
            environment

            <b>SUMMARY:</b> Trapped in the Mexican jungle, a group of friends stumble upon a creeping horror unlike
            anything
            they could ever imagine.
            Two young couples are on a lazy Mexican vacation–sun-drenched days, drunken nights, making friends with
            fellow
            tourists. When the brother
            of one of those friends disappears, they decide to venture into the jungle to look for him. What started out
            as
            a fun day-trip slowly spirals
            into a nightmare when they find an ancient ruins site. and the terrifying presence that lurks there.
