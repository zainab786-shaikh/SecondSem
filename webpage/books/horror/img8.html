        <b>ABOUT:</b> : This book follows the “real” life experiences of the Lutz family, who move into a house in
        Amityville, Long Island, New York
        in 1975. The same house where Ronald Defoe Jr. murdered his entire family the year before. There, the Lutz
        family experiences a paranormal
        haunting.<br><br>
        <b>SUMMARY:</b> “A fascinating and frightening book” (Los Angeles Times)—the bestselling true story about a
        house possessed by evil spirits,
        haunted by psychic phenomena almost too terrible to describe.<br>
        In December 1975, the Lutz family moved into their new home on suburban Long Island. George and Kathleen Lutz
        knew that, one year earlier,
        Ronald DeFeo had murdered his parents, brothers, and sisters in the house, but the property—complete with
        boathouse and swimming pool—and the
        price had been too good to pass up.<br>
        Twenty-eight days later, the entire Lutz family fled in terror.<br>
        This is the spellbinding, shocking true story that gripped the nation about an American dream that turned into a
        nightmare beyond
        imagining—<br>“this book will scare the hell out of you”
