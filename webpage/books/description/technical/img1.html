        <b>ABOUT:</b><br> 
        "The Woman in Cabin 10" is a novel by Ruth Ware, published in 2016. It is a mystery and psychological thriller that follows a travel journalist named Lo Blacklock as she sets off on a luxury cruise ship for a week-long assignment.

"The Woman in Cabin 10" was a popular and commercially successful book, and it became a New York Times and Sunday Times bestseller. It received positive reviews from critics and readers alike, and it has been translated into several languages. The book's success helped establish Ruth Ware as a prominent voice in the mystery and thriller genres, and she has since gone on to write several more successful novels, including "In a Dark, Dark Wood" and "The Turn of the Key".

<b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
"Three of the world's most accomplished and deep thinkers come together to explore Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the way it is transforming human society â€“ and what this technology means for us all. AI is coming online in searching, streaming, medicine, education, and many other fields and, in so doing, transforming how humans are experiencing reality."
IT leaders who are looking for an AI roadmap to our present and our future will find this book useful. One five-star reviewer noted, "this is one of the first books that outlines the consequences of not paying attention to how AI has already entered our lives and will shape our futures. Big ideas and an invitation to take ownership with our historical sovereignty and realize that history will no longer be shaped by our individual will, but by a 'partnership' with AI. Hopefully this will be seen as a collaboration rather than a competition.
