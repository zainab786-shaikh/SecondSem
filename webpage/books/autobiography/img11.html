        <b>ABOUT:</b><br>
        "The Story of My Life" is an autobiography written by Helen Keller, a deaf-blind American author, activist, and
        lecturer who overcame her disabilities to become an important figure in the disability rights movement.
        The book begins with Keller's account of her early years, including her experience of being struck with an
        illness that left her deaf and blind at 19 months old. Despite her disabilities, Keller learned to communicate
        with the help of her teacher, Anne Sullivan, who taught her to use sign language and Braille.
        As Keller grew older, she became a prominent figure in the disability rights movement, advocating for equal
        rights and opportunities for people with disabilities. The book provides a unique insight into Keller's personal
        journey, including her struggles to communicate and her eventual acceptance into Radcliffe College, where she
        graduated with honors.

        world and meeting with political leaders and social activists.
        Overall, "The Story of My Life" is a powerful and inspiring autobiography that highlights the resilience and
        determination of one of the most important figures in the disability rights movement. It is a must-read for
