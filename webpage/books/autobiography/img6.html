            "Usain Bolt: Faster Than Lightning" is an autobiography written by Usain Bolt, one of the greatest sprinters
            of
            all time. The book provides an inside look into Bolt's life and career, from his early days in Jamaica to

            <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
            The book details Bolt's journey from a young boy with a talent for running to becoming a three-time Olympic
            gold
            medalist and a world record holder. It explores his training regimen, his mental approach to racing, and the
            support of his family and coaches.
            Bolt also shares personal stories from his life, including his love of music and partying, and his
            relationships
            with his teammates and competitors. He also discusses his experiences with injury and setbacks, and how he
            overcame them to achieve his goals.
            In addition to Bolt's personal story, the book also provides a behind-the-scenes look into the world of
            elite
            sprinting, including the training, competition, and rivalries that define the sport.
