        <b>ABOUT:</b><br>
        "Dreams from My Father" is an autobiographical memoir written by Barack Obama before he became the 44th
        President of the United States. The book traces Obama's life from his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia, to
        his
        years as a community organizer in Chicago, and his trip to Kenya to reconnect with his African roots.
        <br><br>

        <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
        Obama explores the complexities of his racial and cultural identity, grappling with the legacy of his Kenyan
        father and his white American mother. He also reflects on his formative experiences, including his struggles
        with racism and the ways in which they shaped his worldview and political beliefs.
        "Dreams from My Father" also provides insight into Obama's early political career, including his work as a
        community organizer on Chicago's South Side and his decision to attend law school at Harvard. The book
        explores
        Obama's journey of self-discovery and how it led him to pursue a career in public service, ultimately
        culminating in his historic election as the first African American president of the United States.
