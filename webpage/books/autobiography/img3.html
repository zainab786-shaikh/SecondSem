        <b>ABOUT:</b><br> 
		"Long Walk to Freedom" is an autobiography written by Nelson Mandela, the former President of South Africa and a legendary anti-apartheid revolutionary. The book chronicles Mandela's life from his childhood in rural Transkei, South Africa, to his years as a young lawyer, political activist, prisoner on Robben Island, and ultimately his ascension to the presidency of South Africa.
		<br><br>

		<b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
		"Throughout the book, Mandela describes the oppressive racial segregation and discrimination that he and his fellow Black South Africans faced under the apartheid regime, which denied them basic rights and opportunities. He also discusses his role in the African National Congress (ANC), a political organization dedicated to ending apartheid and achieving democracy in South Africa.
		The book provides an intimate look into Mandela's personal life, including his relationships with his family and his fellow political activists. It also provides insight into his leadership style and his commitment to non-violence, even in the face of extreme brutality and oppression.
