        <b>ABOUT:</b><br> 
		"I Am Malala" is an autobiography written by Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani activist for female education and the youngest Nobel Prize laureate.
		The book begins with an account of Malala's childhood in the Swat Valley region of Pakistan, where she grew up in a family that valued education and social justice. Malala's father was a teacher and an activist, and he encouraged his daughter to speak out against the Taliban's ban on girls' education in the region.
		As Malala became more outspoken about her beliefs, she became a target for the Taliban, who shot her in the head on her way to school in 2012. Despite this near-fatal attack, Malala survived and continued to speak out for girls' education on a global stage.
		<br><br>
		<b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
		Throughout the book, Malala emphasizes the importance of education, especially for girls, and the need for everyone to stand up against injustice and oppression. She also shares her personal experiences of living under Taliban rule and the challenges she faced as a young female activist in a conservative society.
		"I Am Malala" is a powerful and inspiring memoir that highlights the courage and resilience of one young woman in the face of extraordinary adversity. It is a must-read for anyone interested in education, human rights, and the power of one person to make a difference in the world.
