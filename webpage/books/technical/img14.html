        <b>ABOUT:</b><br> 
		"Designing with JavaScript opens up a whole new world to Web-design artists, especially those making the leap from a print-design background. Many people liken Web design to print design, but there is nothing interactive about a printed page. Web pages, however, can be completely dynamic, different from moment to moment and responsive to the reader. The best way to take advantage of this is through JavaScript.
		Eleven chapters and four appendices cover the basics to the complex, from extracting and validating information using forms to creating rotating images to using DHTML for animation.

		<br><br>
	</p>
	<b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
	The first half covers basic yet important issues like an introduction to the syntax of the language, browser detection, setting up forms, and controlling frames and windows. Filled with examples, screen shots, and links to more examples and info, these chapters build a solid foundation for the second half of the book.
		Dynamic images, rollovers, using cookies, and creating interactive features using DHTML are some of the features covered later in the book, with numerous practical examples. These chapters are invaluable for the learning designer, as nearly every feature is practically required on a contemporary Web site. The appendices include a handy JavaScript guide to the language, including syntax, handlers, an object guide, and style properties.".
