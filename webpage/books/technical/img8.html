		<b>ABOUT:</b><br>
		"Understand how designing a technology product in a startup environment is markedly different from product
		design at established companies.
		This book teaches product designers how to think and frame problems in the dynamic context of startups. You will
		discover how to enhance your
		soft skills that are often not taught, but are crucial to your success.".

		<br><br>

		<b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
		In the emerging field of design for technology products, there are many books and resources covering the hard
		skillsâ€•such as visual design, interface design,
		prototyping, and motion design. These skills are necessary to design work; however, without an understanding of
		the true potential of design and the skills
		required to unleash that potential in a startup setting, the impact of design may remain at a production level
		and not reach a position where it can positively
		impact product strategy and the business bottom line. Hacking Product Design addresses that gap in knowledge.
