        <b>ABOUT:</b><br> 
        "Three of the world's most accomplished and deep thinkers come together to explore Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the way it is transforming human society â€“
         and what this technology means for us all. AI is coming online in searching, streaming, medicine, education, and many other fields and, in so doing, transforming how humans are experiencing reality."
        IT leaders who are looking for an AI roadmap to our present and our future will find this book useful. One five-star reviewer noted, "this is one of the first books that outlines the consequences of not 
        paying attention to how AI has already entered our lives and will shape our futures. Big ideas and an invitation to take ownership with our historical sovereignty and realize that history will no longer 
        be shaped by our individual will, but by a 'partnership' with AI. Hopefully this will be seen as a collaboration rather than a competition.".

        <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
        "An AI learned to win chess by making moves human grand masters had never conceived. Another AI discovered a new antibiotic by analyzing molecular properties human scientists did not understand. 
        Now, AI-powered jets are defeating experienced human pilots in simulated dogfights. AI is coming online in searching, streaming, medicine, education, and many other fields and, in so doing, transforming how humans are experiencing reality.
        In The Age of AI, three leading thinkers have come together to consider how AI will change our relationships with knowledge, politics, and the societies in which we live. The Age of AI is an essential roadmap to our present and our future, 
        an era unlike any that has come before.
