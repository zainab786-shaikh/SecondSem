            "Three of the world's most accomplished and deep thinkers come together to explore Artificial Intelligence
            (AI)
            and the way it is transforming human society-
            and what this technology means for us all. AI is coming online in searching, streaming, medicine, education,
            and
            many other fields and, in so doing, transforming how humans are experiencing reality."
            IT leaders who are looking for an AI roadmap to our present and our future will find this book useful. One
            five-star reviewer noted, "this is one of the first books that outlines the consequences of not
            paying attention to how AI has already entered our lives and will shape our futures. Big ideas and an
            invitation
            to take ownership with our historical sovereignty and realize that history will no longer
            be shaped by our individual will, but by a 'partnership' with AI. Hopefully this will be seen as a
            collaboration
            rather than a competition.". <br><br> <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
            "An AI learned to win chess by making moves human grand masters had never conceived. Another AI discovered a
            new
            antibiotic by analyzing molecular properties human scientists did not understand.
            Now, AI-powered jets are defeating experienced human pilots in simulated dogfights. AI is coming online in
            searching, streaming, medicine, education, and many other fields and, in so doing, transforming how humans
            are
            experiencing reality.
            In The Age of AI, three leading thinkers have come together to consider how AI will change our relationships
            with knowledge, politics, and the societies in which we live. The Age of AI is an essential roadmap to our
            present and our future,
            an era unlike any that has come before.
