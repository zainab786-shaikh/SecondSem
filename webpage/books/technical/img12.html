                hours.
                You'll be writing code in a matter of minutes. The explanations are gloriously simple and
                straightforward and there are even online resources if you get stuck. The steps are very easy
                and
                you
                start seeing rewards straight away - there's no toiling away for hours only to find that there's
                still
                really nothing to see. This has been written by people who understand how children's minds work
                -
                and a
                lot of adults too! [â€¦] It's all great stuff and I can't think of a better way to get kids
                started on
                coding. I just wish I'd had this sort of opportunity when I was nine!</td>

                it gives excellent coverage.</td>

                to
                create an app or a game to your own design would be interesting and fun for kids. More advanced
                than
                other coding books I've read, this would be a useful addition to your library, primary or
                secondary.
