        <b>ABOUT:</b><br> 
			"The 8th Edition of the popular Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach builds on the authors’ long tradition of teaching this complex subject through a layered approach in a “top-down manner.” The text works its way from the application layer down toward the physical layer, motivating students by exposing them to important concepts early in their study of networking. Focusing on the Internet and the fundamentally important issues of networking, this text provides an excellent foundation for students in computer science and electrical engineering, without requiring extensive knowledge of programming or mathematics. The 8th Edition has been updated to reflect the most important and exciting recent advances in networking, including software-defined networking (SDN) and the rapid adoption of 4G/5G networks and the mobile applications they enable.".

		<br><br>

		<b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
			"Building on the successful top-down approach of previous editions, the Fourth Edition of Computer Networking continues with an early emphasis on application-layer paradigms and application programming interfaces, encouraging a hands-on experience with protocols and networking concepts. With this edition, Kurose and Ross bring the issues of network security to the forefront, along with integration of the most current and relevant networking technologies.

			Computer Networks and the Internet; Application Layer; Transport Layer; The Network Layer; The Link Layer and Local Area Networks; Wireless and Mobile Networks; Multimedia Networking; Security in Computer Networks; Network Management.

			For all readers interested in computer networking technologies.
