        Kidnapped tells the story of David Balfour, a young man of the Lowlands, the southern part of Scotland.
        David's
        father, Alexander Balfour, has recently died, and his mother
        died some time before, so he is now an orphan. Since he is now seventeen years old, he has decided it is
        time to
        go and seek his fortune.

        <br><br>

        <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
        Tricked by the uncle who has stolen his inheritance, young David Balfour is kidnapped and bound for America.
        Or
        at least that was the plan, until the ship runs into trouble and David is rescued
        by Alan Breck Stewart, fugitive Jacobite and, by his own admission, a ‘bonny fighter’. Balfour, a canny
        lowlander, finds an echo of some wilder and more romantic self in the wilful and courageous Highland
        spirit of Alan Breck. A strange and difficult friendship is born, as their adventures begin.<br>
        Kidnapped has become a classic of historical romance the world over and is justly famous as a novel of
        travel
        and adventure in the Scottish landscape. Stevenson’s vivid descriptive powers were
        never better than in his account of remote places and dangerous action in the Highlands in the years after
        Culloden.
