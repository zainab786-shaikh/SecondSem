        <b>ABOUT:</b><br> 
        White Fang is the story of a wolf dog that is rescued from its brutal owner and gradually becomes domesticated 
        through the patience and kindness of its new owner, Weedon Scott.
		<br><br>

        <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
        White Fang is part dog and part wolf, and the lone survivor of his family. In his lonely world, he soon learns to follow the harsh
         law of the North--kill or be killed. But nothing in White Fang's life can prepare him for the cruel owner who turns him into a vicious killer. Will White Fang ever know the kindness of 
         a gentle master?

			<td><b>Christie</b><br><br>I just finished this and the ending is very, very cute. It bowls you over to such an extent that it feels necessary to calm down and think clearly.
                 I love the ending because it is sweet and definitely overdone and exaggerated and sentimental.</td>

			<td><b>Shreya Agarwal</b><br> <br>I feel that the book is entertaining and that the writer did a good job with the plot and the ending was so cool. 
                Hats off to Jules Vernes for incorporating comedy and romance.</td>

			<td><b>Daniel</b><br><br>It's been many years since I first read White Fang and I have to say that my memories focused on the brightness of the ending 
                rather than the scenes of suffering imparted to such a magnificent creature along the way. While reading these scenes in my younger days, I probably 
                accepted them with a sense of excitement as opposed to my aged self who now accepts them with severe disgust.</td>
