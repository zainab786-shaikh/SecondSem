            <b>ABOUT:</b><br>
            The principal story chronicles the power struggle for the Iron Throne among the great Houses of Westeros
            following the death of King Robert in A Game of Thrones.
            Robert's heir apparent, the 13-year-old Joffrey, is immediately proclaimed king through the machinations of
            his
            mother, Queen Cersei Lannister.
            <br><br>

            <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
            Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where
            summers
            can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning,
            and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s
            protective
            Wall. To the south, the king’s powers are failing—his most trusted adviser dead under
            mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the
            conflict
            lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to.
            Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king’s new Hand, an appointment that threatens
            to
            sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself.<br>Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime
            kingdom of epicurean plenty, A Game of Thrones tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers,
            assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear
            swords
            of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince
            barters
            his sister to win back his throne; a child is lost in the twilight between life and death; and a determined
            woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counter-plots, tragedy
            and
            betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance,
            as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.

                series is cruel, brutal, merciless while also immersive and creatively beautiful. It’s highly

            <td><b>Stassi</b><br><br>I started reading the books instead of watching the show. I always prefered
                that as
                it dwelves your imagination with each word into a sensation in it's own. And it turned out to be
                a
                hell
                of a ride
                with every page through this engaging, raw, intelligent, intense, epic saga! Heavily waiting for
                the
                next book.It's highly detailed and very long..some may hate the detailings but it's worth it.
                Must
                read
                for book lovers.</td>

                first,
                I
                would say, 30% of the book was rather a grind to get through. It wasn't bad, just a bit boring.
                The
                rest
                is just pure expert storytelling.
                The unique way of not having the usual chapters but instead having different point of views
                where we
                could read and see what each character is going through is one my favourite things.</td>

                really
                into the meat of it, it makes sense why people like this book series so much. The best thing
                about
                it
                being so long is that I don't have to worry about the
                dread of finishing a book series and knowing that there's no more for a while!</td>

                characters,
                but
                that was the particular thing that made it different from other books</td>
