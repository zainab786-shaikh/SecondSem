			<td><b>Mario</b><br><br>This is one of Crichton's best novels, which varied widely in quality, and could be called part of the foundation
                 of the Sci-Fi thriller genre with mainstream media adaptions and many great, new authors following in this footsteps.</td>

			<td><b>Mathew</b><br><br>C’mon! It’s Jurassic Park, man! It’s a classic – both book and movie!<br>
            Crichton is one of the kings of speculative sci-fi and how nature and science are to be respected (not trifled with!) 
            Jurassic Park embodies all of these things and if it doesn’t both terrify you and make you think, you have likely missed 
            the point.</td>

			<td><b>Peter</b><br><br>I loved this book. The story is scary, action-packed, and kept me reading. Throughout the beginning and middle,
                 there were a lot of similarities to the movie, but the entire last portion of the book was completely different, in a good way.</td>

			<td><b>Alex</b><br> <br>It's been many years since I've watched the movie and after reading this, I feel like I would be doing myself a disservice if
                 didn't go watch it again. Someone pointed out that the book is adult horror in nature while the film was re-imagined for a larger audience. I will
                  have to agree with that assessment because this book was downright terrifying at times. Sure, Crichton leaves some deaths to our imagination, but the
                   ones he does describe are filthy and disgusting.</td>
