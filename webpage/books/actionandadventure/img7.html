        <b>ABOUT:</b><br>
        Thomas, the sixteen years old hero, remembers nothing about himself except his name. His memory has been wiped,
        as have all
        the memories of the Gladers, the teenagers who inhabit the maze. The only thing Thomas can recall is that he
        must solve the Maze
        to save himself and the other Gladers
        <br><br>

        <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
        A group of teenagers, who call themselves "Gladers", are left in a strange place which they call the "Glade".
        The Glade is surrounded
        by four doors, leading to the Maze, that close every night at sundown and open in the morning. Beyond the walls
        of the Glade is the ever-changing Maze,
        populated by horrifying, biomechanical creatures, called Grievers. Every month, a newcomer, nicknamed "Greenie",
        joins the Gladers, sent by a lift they
        call the Box. Each newcomer has all past memories (except language and other common things) wiped out. The only
        thing that they remember is their name. They
        are watched by mechanical beetles, called 'beetle blades' which belong to their 'creators'. Each beetle blade
        has the word "WICKED" stamped across its back.
        The ultimate goal of the Gladers is to find a way out of the Maze. To do so, certain Gladers called "Runners"
        venture into the Maze every day, to map it in an
        attempt to find a pattern in the Maze that would lead them to find an exit. The main character, Thomas, arrives
        at the Glade. Shortly thereafter, a girl (Teresa)
        is sent up through the Box, arriving in a coma, and bringing the message: Everything is going to change. She
        bears a note saying "She's the last one. Ever." Thomas
        becomes an object of reverence, suspicion, and great curiosity to the Gladers due to his ties to all of the
        strange happenings in the Glade, fueled greatly after he becomes
        the first to survive a night inside the Maze. Together with new friends, such as Chuck (the second-newest
        newbie), Newt (second in command of the Gladers), and Minho (Keeper of the Runners),
        he begins to solve the mystery of the Maze and search for a way out. Thomas leads his group to make it out of
        the maze and find a way back home and defeat WICKED.

                amazing, mind-blowing, heart-racing, and every page you turn - a new adventure begins.
                It is one of my favorite books. I can’t wait to read the second book, and so on in the series</td>

            <td><b>Hannah</b><br><br>This book was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I decided to read it because it looked
                interesting and I love dystopian fiction, and I certainly did NOT regret it. I finished the Maze Runner
                in a day and am jumping to the second book right away because this is by far the BEST thriller I've ever
                read!!!!! Definitely LOADS better than The Hunger Games in my opinion. Has way more action sequences,
                a better plot, so much intriguing mystery, way less romance (FINALLYYYY). Sure it has some bad language
                usage, but bravery, courage, and selflessness are portrayed beautifully in it's AWESOME characters. The
                action sequences are so intense, my heart was literally pounding in anticipation when reading them, and
                at some parts, I got so nervous that my stomach turned sour!!!!!! This book got me hooked right from the
                beginning, definitely recommend it to YA adult readers who are looking for an interesting dystopian
                read.</td>

            <td><b>Alex</b><br><br>Let’s just start with, THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!! So much great detail and it has
                one of the most incredible story ever. This book also has so many great cliff hangers. Every chapter
                makes you
                wonder what happens in the next chapter. It also has interesting dialogue as the use different words to
                say something like good that or shuck it. Wonderful adventure and I definitely recommend this to people
                in 5th grade and up.</td>

                character ( cough, Katniss, Tris, cough) and that made this novel very fresh for me.</td>

            <td><b>Elie</b><br><br>whether you have seen the movies or not, this book is one of the best dystopian’s to
                read. Not only do many of the events completely differ from the film, it gives you much more perspective
                into the mind of thomas and his connections with teresa.</td>
