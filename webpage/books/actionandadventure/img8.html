            <b>ABOUT:</b><br>
            The Hobbit is set in Middle-earth and follows home-loving Bilbo Baggins, the titular hobbit, who joins the
            wizard Gandalf
            and thirteen dwarves that make up Thorin Oakenshield's Company, on a quest to reclaim the dwarves' home and
            treasure from the dragon Smaug.
            <br><br>

            <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
            In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms
            and an
            oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a
            hobbit-hole,
            and that means comfort.
            Written for J.R.R. Tolkienâ€™s own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was first
            published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the
            wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the
            spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous
            ring,
            and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent. The text in this 372-page paperback edition is based on that
            first
            published
            in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics (1998), and includes a note on the text by Douglas A. Anderson
            (2001).

            <td><b>Scarlet</b><br><br>I appreciated this compelling novel by the infamous J. R. R. Tolkien and
                ended
                up
                finishing the book 2 or 3 days before my fellow peers, and the audiobook that the teacher played
                along
                with it gave it a cinematic aura.
                Reading this has inspired me so much, and overall it simply screams "fairytale". It feels like
                an
                enchanting bedtime story, with dragons and wizards, and other whatnot. Every aspect of it just
                feels...magical.</td>

            <td><b>Dave</b><br><br>Truly magnificent story. Readers over the age of ten are in for a real treat
                with
                this timeless classic. I cannot fathom how one man can make such an endless world, and only a
                fraction
                of that is shown in The Hobbit!
                I wish so badly to read this again for the first time and be swept off on a truly unexpected
                adventure
                with Thorin and Company, (truly, I was so surprised reading this for the first time!). Overall
                amazing
                book! An excellent prelude to The
                Lord of the Rings.</td>

            <td><b>Stephan</b><br><br>After 85 years the Hobbit still stands the test of time as the best book I
                have
                ever read in a while. The book starts off with our character named Bilbo Baggins and he lives in
                a
                lovely hobbit hole called Bag End. In my
                opinion the beginning of the story is presented perfectly because it introduces us to the main
                characters very quickly and gets straight to the point. Then we are introduced to Gandalf who is
                a
                wizard who persuades Bilbo to go on an adventure with him.</td>

                in
                my
                11 years of life, I have read a lot of books!!!!!!!! The story is about Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit
                living
                in a hole in a hill. He hates going on adventures but
                ends up in one of the most adventurous journeys ever!!!</td>
