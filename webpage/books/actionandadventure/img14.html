        The Mysterious Island follows the adventures of a group of castaways who use their survivalist savvy to build a functional
         community on an uncharted island. A hot-air balloon carrying five passengers and a dog escapes from Richmond, Va., during the American Civil War.
		<br><br>

        <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
        After hijacking a balloon from a Confederate camp, a band of five northern prisoners escapes the American Civil War. Seven thousand miles later, they drop
         from the clouds onto an uncharted volcanic island in the Pacific. Through teamwork, scientific knowledge, engineering, and perseverance, they endeavour to
          build a colony from scratch. But this island of abundant resources has its secrets. The castaways discover they are not alone. A shadowy, yet familiar, agent of their unfathomable fate is watching.<br>
        What unfolds in Jules Verneâ€™s imaginative marvel is both an enthralling mystery and the ultimate in survivalist adventures.

			<td><b>Alphayo</b><br><br>This is a very wonderful book enacted in the movie. The science used in making out the movie is incredible. I like the Hank character who acts in a very composed mood. 
                I was perturbed at the island where every big organism becomes small while the vice versa is true. Hehehehe, I can't imagine riding on a bee for heaven's sake. Such an incredible and creative story.</td>
