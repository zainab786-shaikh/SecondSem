        <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
        The Swiss Family Robinson (German: Der Schweizerische Robinson, "The Swiss Robinsons") is a novel by Johann David Wyss, first published in 1812, about a Swiss 
        family of immigrants whose ship en route to Port Jackson, Australia, goes off course and is shipwrecked in the East Indies. The ship's crew is lost, but the 
        family and several domestic animals survive. They make their way to shore, where they build a settlement, undergoing several adventures before being rescued;
         some refuse rescue and remain on the island.<br><br>The book is the most successful of a large number of "Robinsonade" novels that were written in response to
          the success of Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719). It has gone through a large number of versions and adaptations.

			<td><b>Adreinne</b><br><br>Terrific. Always meant to read this. They were so lucky to be on an island with such a huge variety of plants snd animals for their survival. Plus that the father was a naturalist - to recognize and know how to use them.</td>

			<td><b>Lisa</b><br> <br>First, how can you not like such an amazingly wonderful family adventure story!<br><br>
                I'm pretty sure that a little part of each of us wishes that we'd get shipwrecked on such a gorgeous island with our family about us and have to live in a dazzling tree house! For a little while at least</td>
