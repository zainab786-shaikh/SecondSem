            <b>ABOUT:</b><br>
            In this classic adventure story, a wealthy gentleman, Phileas Fogg, makes a bet that he can travel around
            the
            world in eighty days.
            Fogg and his servant set off immediately, determined to win this race against time. Little do they know they
            aren't making the journey alone....
            <br><br>

            <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
            One night in the reform club, Phileas Fogg bets his companions that he can travel across the globe in just
            eighty days. Breaking the well-established
            routine of his daily life, he immediately sets off for Dover with his astonished valet Passepartout. Passing
            through exotic lands and dangerous locations, they seize whatever
            transportation is at hand—whether train or elephant—overcoming set-backs and always racing against the
            clock.

                after
                returning due to time zones of
                the world. Written by a great writer, Jules Verne, it is one of my favorite classic books of all
                time!!
                The overall premise of the story, the travel of the world in 80 days, is so thrilling
                that it makes the reader imagine going around the world in 80 days and thinking about the perils
                one
                would come across. When compared to this novel, it sets the bar higher than today.<br>

                India it's really a must read book and it also teaches that we should be very particular towards
