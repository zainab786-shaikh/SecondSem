		<b>ABOUT:</b><br>
		The plot follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, during which a series of
		messages on the walls
		of the school's corridors warn that the "Chamber of Secrets" has been opened and that the "heir of
		Slytherin"
		would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families.
		<br><br>

		<b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
		Ever since Harry Potter had come home for the summer, the Dursleys had been so mean and hideous that all
		Harry
		wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.
		But just as he’s packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange impish creature who says that if
		Harry returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.<br>
		And strike it does. For in Harry’s second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an
		outrageously stuck-up new professor and a spirit who
		haunts the girls’ bathroom. But then the real trouble begins – someone is turning Hogwarts students to
		stone.
		Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever?
		Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at
		Hogwarts
		most suspects… Harry Potter himself!

			<td><b>Sasha Alsberg</b><br><br>JK Rowling really knows how to write a great book, thats for sure!
				Although
				this wasn't my favorite book in the series, it definitely wasn't because it was bad. I loved the
				plot
				and conflict, even though it wasn't as intense as the others were. I was definitely shocked at the
				end...so epic and mind blowing!</td>

			<td><b>Finnik</b><br><br>This book is very exiting and interesting to read! It is about Harry Potter in
				his
				second year at Hogwarts trying to find the heir of Slytherin who is the one behind mysterious
				attacks on
				students. My favourite part is when he finds Tom Riddle’s diary because it leads him to finding out
				Hagrid opened the chamber. I’m my opinion it was one of the best books!</td>

			<td><b>Diksha Agarwal</b><br><br>I really liked Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets because it was
				really deep and very time consuming. The Chamber of Secrets
				really made me feel all the feels. I felt sad at one point mad at another there really is no way you
				would already know what happens in Harry Potter (Especially in the Chamber of Secrets)
				You would have to predict it all and see if your right at the end. This book is very exiting and
				interesting to read!</td>
