        <b>Authors:</b> <i> Erskine Childers<br></i> <br><b>Date of publish:</b> <i> May 1903</i><br><br>
        Set in 1901, and starring Michael York, Simon MacCorkindale and Jenny Agutter, it concerns the efforts of two British yachtsmen to avert a plot by the German Empire
         to launch a seaborne military invasion of the United Kingdom.
		<br><br>

        <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
        While on a sailing trip in the Baltic Sea, two young adventurers-turned-spies uncover a secret German plot to invade England. Written by Childers—who served in the Royal Navy
         during World War I—as a wake-up call to the British government to attend to its North Sea defenses, The Riddle of the Sands accomplished that task and has been considered a classic 
         of espionage literature ever since, praised as much for its nautical action as for its suspenseful spycraft.
