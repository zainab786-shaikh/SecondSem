            Set in 1901, and starring Michael York, Simon MacCorkindale and Jenny Agutter, it concerns the efforts of
            two
            British yachtsmen to avert a plot by the German Empire
            to launch a seaborne military invasion of the United Kingdom.

            <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
            While on a sailing trip in the Baltic Sea, two young adventurers-turned-spies uncover a secret German plot
            to
            invade England. Written by Childers—who served in the Royal Navy
            during World War I—as a wake-up call to the British government to attend to its North Sea defenses, The
            Riddle
            of the Sands accomplished that task and has been considered a classic
            of espionage literature ever since, praised as much for its nautical action as for its suspenseful spycraft.

                descriptive
