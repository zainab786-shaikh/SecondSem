        <b>Authors:</b> <i> Jules Verne<br></i> <br><b>Date of publish:</b> <i> 25 November 1864</i><br><br>
        <b>ABOUT:</b><br> 
        Originally published in French in 1864, Journey to the Center of the Earth tells the story of Professor Lidenbrock, his nephew, and a hired guide who, 
        following the instructions of a medieval alchemist claiming to have found a passage to the center of the earth, travel deep into an Icelandic volcano.
		<br><br>

        <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
        An adventurous geology professor chances upon a manuscript in which a 16th-century explorer claims to have found a route to the earth's core. Professor 
        Lidenbrock can't resist the opportunity to investigate, and with his nephew Axel, he sets off across Iceland in the company of Hans Bjelke, a native guide.<br><br>
        The expedition descends into an extinct volcano toward a sunless sea, where they encounter a subterranean world of luminous rocks, antediluvian forests, and fantastic
         marine life â€” a living past that holds the secrets to the origins of human existence.

			<td><b>Jenne</b><br><br>Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth is one of my all-time favorite books.  I re-read it every year.  I love the discourse on 
                geology and other earth sciences which,at that time, were still mostly unknown and mysterious.</td>

			<td><b>Peter</b><br><br>It is a classic book, I recommend it for today's generation. It takes the reader to a third realm combining reality and fantasy.  Although 
                it is fiction, it is imagination that takes him to the heights of adventure, and to know more about life and our world.</td>
