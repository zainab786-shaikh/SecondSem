        <b>ABOUT:</b><br>
        Moby-Dick; or, The Whale is an 1851 novel by American writer Herman Melville. The book is the sailor Ishmael's
        narrative of the maniacal
        quest of Ahab, captain of the whaling ship Pequod, for vengeance against Moby Dick, the giant white sperm whale
        that bit off his leg on the ship's previous voyage.
        <br><br>

        <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
        So Melville wrote of his masterpiece, one of the greatest works of imagination in literary history. In part,
        Moby-Dick is the story of an eerily compelling madman pursuing an
        unholy war against a creature as vast and dangerous and unknowable as the sea itself. But more than just a novel
        of adventure, more than an encyclopaedia of whaling lore and legend,
        the book can be seen as part of its author's lifelong meditation on America. Written with wonderfully redemptive
        humour, Moby-Dick is also a profound inquiry into character, faith, and
        the nature of perception.<br>This edition of Moby-Dick, which reproduces the definitive text of the novel,
        includes invaluable explanatory notes, along with maps, illustrations, and a
        glossary of nautical terms.

            <td><b>Ayana Playle</b><br><br>However, the more I read the more I began to love Moby Dick. The
                characterisation is brilliant and the symbolism is amazing. It’s actually a really funny book,
                which is not something I would have thought I’d have ever said when I first started reading it. It gets
                better the more you understand the meanings Melville is trying to convey - and it’s
                much deeper than just don’t interfere with nature.</td>
