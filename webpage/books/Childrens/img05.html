<b>SUMMARY:</b><br>	
		<p>
Charlotte's Web is a classic children's book written by E.B. White and published in 1952. It tells the story of a young pig named Wilbur who is saved from being slaughtered by a spider named Charlotte. The book explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and the cycle of life and death.
		<br><br>
The story begins on the Zuckerman farm where Wilbur is born. He is the runt of the litter and is very small and weak. Fern, the farmer's daughter, convinces her father to let her keep Wilbur as a pet. Fern takes care of Wilbur, but as he grows bigger, she realizes that he will soon be sold to the butcher. She decides to save him by finding him a new home.
		<br><br>
Wilbur is eventually taken to the barn of the neighboring farm, where he meets a variety of animals including a wise old spider named Charlotte. Wilbur quickly makes friends with the other animals, but he is still worried about his fate. Charlotte promises to help him and comes up with a plan to save his life.
		<br><br>
Charlotte begins spinning webs in the barn with words written in them, such as "Some Pig," "Terrific," and "Radiant." The other animals are amazed by Charlotte's ability to write, and soon the news of Wilbur's amazing qualities spreads throughout the countryside. As a result, Wilbur becomes famous and is no longer in danger of being slaughtered.
		<br><br>
However, as time passes, Charlotte begins to weaken and eventually dies, leaving Wilbur heartbroken. Before she dies, she lays an egg sac containing hundreds of baby spiders. Wilbur promises to take care of them and keep Charlotte's memory alive.
		<br><br>
The story ends with Wilbur winning a prize at the county fair and returning to the Zuckerman farm where he lives out the rest of his days with his new spider friends. The book concludes with the famous line, "It is not often that someone comes along who is a true friend and a good writer. Charlotte was both."
