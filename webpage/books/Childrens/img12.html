<b>SUMMARY:</b><br>

"Rapunzel" is a classic fairy tale that originated in Germany. The story follows a young girl who is locked in a tower by a wicked witch as punishment for her parents stealing vegetables from the witch's garden. The witch tells Rapunzel that she will only be allowed to leave the tower if she promises to never leave, but the girl eventually falls in love with a prince who climbs up her long hair to visit her.
		<br><br>
The witch regularly visits Rapunzel in the tower and uses her long hair to climb up to the top. The witch uses the visits to threaten and scare Rapunzel, telling her that she will harm the prince if she ever tries to escape or tells him about the tower. Despite this, Rapunzel and the prince plan to escape, and the prince brings a length of silk to use as a rope to climb up the tower.

One day, the witch discovers the prince visiting Rapunzel and cuts off her long hair, causing the prince to fall from the tower. The prince is blinded by thorns when he lands, but he wanders around the forest and eventually hears Rapunzel singing a lullaby.
