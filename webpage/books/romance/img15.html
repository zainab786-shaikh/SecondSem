            SUMMARY:Rowan
            I'm in the business of creating fairy tales.
            Theme parks. Production companies. Five-star hotels.
            Everything could be all mine if I renovated Dreamland.
            My initial idea of hiring Zahra was good in theory, but then I kissed her.
            Things spiraled out of control once I texted her using an alias.
            By the time I realized where I went wrong, it was too late.
            People like me don't get happy endings.
            Not when we're destined to ruin them.
            <br><br>

            Zahra
            After submitting a drunk proposal criticizing Dreamland's most expensive ride, I should have been fired.
            Instead, Rowan Kane offered me a dream job.
            The catch? I had to work for the most difficult boss I'd ever met.
            Rowan was rude and completely off-limits, but my heart didn't care.
            At least not until I discovered his secret.
            It was time to teach the billionaire that money couldn't fix everything.
            Especially not us.
