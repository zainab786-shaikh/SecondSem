            Author: <i>Elena Armas</i>> is a Spanish writer, a self confessed hopeless romantic and a proud book
            hoarder.
            Now, she's also the author of
            International bestseller and soon to be adapted to film The Spanish Love Deception; and instant New York
            Times
            bestseller The American Roommate Experiment. Her books will soon be translated to 32 languages–which is
            absolutely
            bananas, if you ask her.

            She hopes her stories make your heart skip a beat or two, your palms a little sweaty, and your cheeks flush
            in
            that rosy
            pink that makes other people want to peek at the page you are reading.

            SUMMARY:Catalina Martín desperately needs a date to her sister’s wedding. Especially since her little white
            lie
            about her
            American boyfriend has spiralled out of control. Now everyone she knows—including her ex and his
            fiancée—will be
            there
            and eager to meet him.<br><br>

            She only has four weeks to find someone willing to cross the Atlantic and aid in her deception. New York to
            Spain is no
            short flight and her raucous family won’t be easy to fool.<br><br>

            Enter Aaron Blackford—her tall, handsome, condescending colleague—who surprisingly offers to step in. She’d
            rather
            refuse; never has there been a more aggravating, blood-boiling, and insufferable man.

            But Catalina is desperate, and as the wedding draws nearer, Aaron looks like her best option. And she begins
            to
            realize
            he might not be as terrible in the real world as he is at the office.<br><br>
