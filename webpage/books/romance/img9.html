        SUMMARY:She can never be his...but he's taking her anyway.

        Stoic, broody, and arrogant, elite bodyguard Rhys Larsen has two rules: 1) Protect his clients at all costs
        2)
        Do not
        become emotionally involved. Ever.

        He has never once been tempted to break those rules…until her.

        Bridget von Ascheberg. A princess with a stubborn streak that matches his own and a hidden fire that reduces
        his
        rules
        to ash. She’s nothing he expected and everything he never knew he needed.<br><br>

        Day by day, inch by inch, she breaks down his defenses until he’s faced with a truth he can no longer deny:
        he
        swore an
        oath to protect her, but all he wants is to ruin her. Take her.

        Because she’s his.

        His princess.
        His forbidden fruit.
        His every depraved fantasy.<br><br>

        ***
        <br>
        Regal, strong-willed, and bound by the chains of duty, Princess Bridget dreams of the freedom to live and
        love
        as she
        chooses.

        But when her brother abdicates, she’s suddenly faced with the prospect of a loveless, politically expedient
        marriage and
        a throne she never wanted.

        And as she navigates the intricacies—and treacheries—of her new role, she must also hide her desire for a
        man
        she can’t
        have.

        Her bodyguard.
        Her protector.
        Her ultimate ruin.

        Unexpected and forbidden, theirs is a love that could destroy a kingdom…and doom them both.

        Twisted Games is a slow to medium burn contemporary royal bodyguard romance. It’s book two of the Twisted
        series
        but can
        be read as a standalone.<br><br>
