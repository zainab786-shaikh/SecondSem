            SUMMARY:He'll do anything to have her...including lie.

            Charming, deadly, and smart enough to hide it, Christian Harper is a monster dressed in the perfectly
            tailored
            suits of
            a gentleman.

            He has little use for morals and even less use for love, but he can’t deny the strange pull he feels toward
            the
            woman
            living just one floor below him.

            She’s the object of his darkest desires, the only puzzle he can’t solve. And when the opportunity to get
            closer
            to her
            arises, he breaks his own rules to offer her a deal she can’t refuse.

            Every monster has their weakness. She’s his.<br>

            His obsession.
            His addiction.
            His only exception.
            <br>
            **
            <br>
            Sweet, shy, and introverted despite her social media fame, Stella Alonso is a romantic who keeps her heart
            in a
            cage.

            Between her two jobs, she has little time or desire for a relationship.

            But when a threat from her past drives her into the arms—and house—of the most dangerous man she’s ever met,
            she’s
            tempted to let herself feel something for the first time in a long time.

            Because despite Christian’s cold nature, he makes her feel everything when she’s with him.<br><br>

            Passionate.
            Protected.
            Truly wanted.
            <br>

            Theirs is a love twisted with secrets and tainted by lies…and when the truths are finally revealed, they
            could
            shatter
            everything.

            Twisted Lies is a steamy, medium to slow burn fake dating romance. It is the fourth and final book in the
            Twisted series
            but can be read as a standalone<br><br>
