        About:I'm Ali, and I write contemporary romcom novels about women in STEM and academia. I love cats,
        Nutella,
        and side
        ponytails. I'm also currently learning to crochet, so as you can tell I'm a super busy gal with an intense
        and
        exciting
        life!
        <br><br>

        SUMMARY:As a third-year Ph.D. candidate, Olive Smith doesn't believe in lasting romantic relationships--but
        her
        best friend
        does, and that's what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way
        to a
        happily
        ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like
        any
        self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees.<br><br>

        That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor--and well-known ass. Which is why Olive
        is
        positively floored when Stanford's reigning lab tyrant agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake
        boyfriend.
        But when a big science conference goes haywire, putting Olive's career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises
        her
        again
        with his unyielding support and even more unyielding... six-pack abs.<br><br>

        Suddenly their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion. And Olive discovers that the only
        thing
        more
        complicated than a hypothesis on love is putting her own heart under the microscope.
