            Author: <i>Helen Hoang</i> Originally published: <i>5 June 2018</i>
            About:Helen Hoang is that shy person who never talks. Until she does. And the worst things fly out of her
            mouth.
            She read her
            first romance novel in eighth grade and has been addicted ever since. In 2016, she was diagnosed with Autism
            Spectrum
            Disorder in line with what was previously known as Asperger’s Syndrome. Her journey inspired THE KISS
            QUOTIENT.
            She
            currently lives in San Diego, California with her husband, two kids, and pet fish.<br><br><br>
            SUMMARY:A heartwarming and refreshing debut novel that proves one thing: there's not enough data in the
            world to
            predict what
            will make your heart tick.

            Stella Lane thinks math is the only thing that unites the universe. She comes up with algorithms to predict
            customer
            purchases—a job that has given her more money than she knows what to do with, and way less experience in the
            dating
            department than the average thirty-year-old.<br><br>

            It doesn't help that Stella has Asperger's and French kissing reminds her of a shark getting its teeth
            cleaned
            by pilot
            fish. Her conclusion: she needs lots of practice—with a professional. Which is why she hires escort Michael
            Phan. The
            Vietnamese and Swedish stunner can't afford to turn down Stella's offer, and agrees to help her check off
            all
            the boxes
            on her lesson plan—from foreplay to more-than-missionary position...<br><br>

            Before long, Stella not only learns to appreciate his kisses, but to crave all the other things he's making
            her
            feel.
            Soon, their no-nonsense partnership starts making a strange kind of sense. And the pattern that emerges will
            convince
            Stella that love is the best kind of logic...
