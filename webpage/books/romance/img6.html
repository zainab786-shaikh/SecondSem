        Author: <i>Emily Henry</i> Originally published: <i>3 May 2022</i>
        About:Emily Henry is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Book Lovers, People We Meet on Vacation,
        and
        Beach Read, as
        well as the forthcoming Happy Place. She lives and writes in Cincinnati and the part of Kentucky just
        beneath
        it<br><br>

        SUMMARY:One summer. Two rivals. A plot twist they didn't see coming....<br><br>

        Nora Stephens’ life is books—she’s read them all—and she is not that type of heroine. Not the plucky one,
        not
        the
        laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. In fact, the only people Nora is a heroine for are
        her
        clients,
        for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister
        Libby.<br><br>

        Which is why she agrees to go to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina for the month of August when Libby begs her
        for
        a
        sisters’ trip away—with visions of a small-town transformation for Nora, who she’s convinced needs to become
        the
        heroine
        in her own story. But instead of picnics in meadows, or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or
        bulging-forearmed
        bartender, Nora keeps bumping into Charlie Lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. It would
        be
        a
        meet-cute if not for the fact that they’ve met many times and it’s never been cute.<br><br>

        If Nora knows she’s not an ideal heroine, Charlie knows he’s nobody’s hero, but as they are thrown together
        again and
        again—in a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow—what they discover might just
        unravel
        the
        carefully crafted stories they’ve written about themselves.
