            SUMMARY:She’s the wife he never wanted…and the weakness he never saw coming.<br><br>

            Ruthless. Meticulous. Arrogant.

            Dante Russo thrives on control, both personally and professionally.

            The billionaire CEO never planned to marry—
            until the threat of blackmail forces him into an engagement with a woman he barely knows.

            Vivian Lau, jewelry heiress and daughter of his newest enemy.<br><br>

            It doesn’t matter how beautiful or charming she is. He'll do everything in his power to destroy the evidence
            and
            their
            betrothal.

            There’s only one problem: now that he has her...he can't bring himself to let her go.<br><br>

            ***
            Elegant. Ambitious. Well-mannered.

            Vivian Lau is the perfect daughter and her family’s ticket into the highest echelons of high society.

            Marrying a blue-blooded Russo means opening doors that would otherwise remain closed to her new-money
            family.

            While the rude, elusive Dante isn't her idea of a dream partner, she agrees to their arranged marriage out
            of
            duty.

            Craving his touch was never part of the plan.

            Neither was the worst thing she could possibly do: fall in love with her future husband.<br><br>
