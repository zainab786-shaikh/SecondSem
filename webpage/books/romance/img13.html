        SUMMARY:They had nothing in common until love gave them everything to lose . . .

        Louisa Clark is an ordinary girl living an exceedingly ordinary life—steady boyfriend, close family—who has
        barely been
        farther afield than their tiny village. She takes a badly needed job working for ex–Master of the Universe
        Will
        Traynor,
        who is wheelchair bound after an accident. Will has always lived a huge life—big deals, extreme sports,
        worldwide
        travel—and now he’s pretty sure he cannot live the way he is.
        <br><br>
        Will is acerbic, moody, bossy—but Lou refuses to treat him with kid gloves, and soon his happiness means
        more to
        her
        than she expected. When she learns that Will has shocking plans of his own, she sets out to show him that
        life
        is still
        worth living.

        A Love Story for this generation and perfect for fans of John Green’s The Fault in Our Stars, Me Before You
        brings to
        life two people who couldn’t have less in common—a heartbreakingly romantic novel that asks, What do you do
        when
        making
        the person you love happy also means breaking your own heart?<br><br>
