            SUMMARY:
            Pride and Prejudice follows the turbulent relationship between Elizabeth Bennet, the daughter of a country
            gentleman,
            and Fitzwilliam Darcy, a rich aristocratic landowner. They must overcome the titular sins of pride and
            prejudice
            in
            order to fall in love and marry.<br>
            Mr Bennet, owner of the Longbourn estate in Hertfordshire, has five daughters, but his property is entailed
            and
            can
            only
            be passed to a male heir. His wife also lacks an inheritance, so his family faces becoming poor upon his
            death.
            Thus, it
            is imperative that at least one of the daughters marries well to support the others, which is a motivation
            that
            drives
            the plot.<br>
            At a ball, the family is introduced to the Netherfield party, including Mr Bingley, his two sisters and Mr
            Darcy, his
            dearest friend. Mr Bingley's friendly and cheerful manner earns him popularity among the guests. He appears
            interested
            in Jane, the eldest Bennet daughter. Mr Darcy, reputed to be twice as wealthy as Mr Bingley, is haughty and
            aloof,
            causing a decided dislike of him. He declines to dance with Elizabeth, the second-eldest Bennet daughter, as
            she
            is "not
            handsome enough". Although she jokes about it with her friend, Elizabeth is deeply offended. Despite this
            first
            impression, Mr Darcy secretly begins to find himself drawn to Elizabeth as they continue to encounter each
            other
            at
            social events, appreciating her wit and frankness.<br>
