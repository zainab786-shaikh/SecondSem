        SUMMARY:Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she
        wants.
        She’s come a long
        way from the small town in Maine where she grew up — she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and
        started
        her own
        business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s
        life
        suddenly
        seems almost too good to be true.<br><br>

        Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total
        soft
        spot for
        Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s
        complete
        aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no
        dating”
        rule, she
        can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.<br><br>

        As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and
        a
        link to
        the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears,
        everything
        Lily has
        built with Ryle is threatened.<br><br>
