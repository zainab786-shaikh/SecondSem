            SUMMARY:He has a heart of ice...but for her, he'd burn the world.

            Alex Volkov is a devil blessed with the face of an angel and cursed with a past he can’t escape.

            Driven by a tragedy that has haunted him for most of his life, his ruthless pursuits for success and
            vengeance
            leave
            little room for matters of the heart.<br><br>

            But when he’s forced to look after his best friend’s sister, he starts to feel something in his chest:

            A crack.
            A melt.
            A fire that could end his world as he knew it.

            ***

            icy
            exterior of a man she shouldn’t want.<br><br>

            them
            both…and everything they hold dear.
