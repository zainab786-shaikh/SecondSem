            Author:It Starts With Us by <i>Colleen Hoover</i> chronicles the rekindled romance between lost lovers and
            childhood
            friends Lily
            Bloom and Atlas Corrigan. Published in 2022, It Starts With Us is the sequel to Hoover’s popular 2016 novel
            It
            Ends With
            Us, a New York Times best seller, winner of the 2016 Goodreads Choice Award for Best Romance, and an
            upcoming
            film.<br><br>
            Written from the alternating perspectives of both Lily and Atlas, It Starts With Us explores the
            complexities of
            divorce, domestic violence, and trauma.

            SUMMARY:Lily and her ex-husband, Ryle, have just settled into a civil coparenting rhythm when she suddenly
            bumps
            into her first
            love, Atlas, again. After nearly two years separated, she is elated that for once, time is on their side,
            and
            she
            immediately says yes when Atlas asks her on a date.<br><br>

            But her excitement is quickly hampered by the knowledge that, though they are no longer married, Ryle is
            still
            very much
            a part of her life—and Atlas Corrigan is the one man he will hate being in his ex-wife and daughter’s life.

            Switching between the perspectives of Lily and Atlas, It Starts with Us picks up right where the epilogue
            for
            the
            “gripping, pulse-pounding” (Sarah Pekkanen, author of Perfect Neighbors) bestselling phenomenon It Ends with
            Us
            left
            off. Revealing more about Atlas’s past and following Lily as she embraces a second chance at true love while
            navigating
            a jealous ex-husband, it proves that “no one delivers an emotional read like Colleen Hoover”<br><br>
