            SUMMARY:He hates her...almost as much as he wants her.<br><br>

            Gorgeous, cocky, and fast on his way to becoming a hotshot doctor, Josh Chen has never met a woman he
            couldn’t
            charm—except for Jules f**king Ambrose.

            The beautiful redhead has been a thorn in his side since they met, but she also consumes his thoughts in a
            way
            no woman
            ever has.

            When their animosity explodes into one unforgettable night, he proposes a solution that’ll get her out of
            his
            system
            once and for all: an enemies with benefits arrangement with simple rules.

            No jealousy.

            No strings attached.

            And absolutely no falling in love.<br><br>

            **

            Outgoing and ambitious, Jules Ambrose is a former party girl who’s focused on one thing: passing the
            attorney’s
            bar
            exam.

            The last thing she needs is to get involved with a doctor who puts the SUFFER in insufferable…no matter how
            good-looking
            he is.

            But the more she gets to know him, the more she realizes there’s more than meets the eye to the man she’s
            hated
            for so
            long.

            Her best friend’s brother.

            Her nemesis.

            And her only salvation.<br><br>


            Theirs is a match made in hell, and when the demons from their past catch up with them, they’re faced with
            truths that
            could either save them …or destroy everything they’ve worked for.

            Twisted Hate is a steamy enemies with benefits/enemies to lovers romance. It's book three in the Twisted
            series
            but can
            be read as a standalone.
