            <u>About:</u>Kerri Maniscalco grew up in a semi-haunted house outside NYC where her fascination with gothic
            settings began. In her
            spare time she reads everything she can get her hands on, cooks all kinds of food with her family and
            friends,
            and
            drinks entirely too much tea while discussing life’s finer points with her cats.
            <br><br>
            <u>SUMMARY:</u>Two sisters.
            One brutal murder.
            A quest for vengeance that will unleash Hell itself...
            And an intoxicating romance.
            <br><br>
            Emilia and her twin sister Vittoria are streghe - witches who live secretly among humans, avoiding notice
            and
            persecution. One night, Vittoria misses dinner service at the family's renowned Sicilian restaurant. Emilia
            soon
            finds
            the body of her beloved twin...desecrated beyond belief. Devastated, Emilia sets out to find her sister's
            killer
            and to
            seek vengeance at any cost—even if it means using dark magic that's been long forbidden.
            <br><br>
            Then Emilia meets Wrath, one of the Wicked—princes of Hell she has been warned against in tales since she
            was a
            child.
            Wrath claims to be on Emilia's side, tasked by his master with solving the series of women's murders on the
            island. But
            when it comes to the Wicked, nothing is as it seems... <br><br>
