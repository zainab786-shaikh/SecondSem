        <u>SUMMARY:</u>Feyre has undergone more trials than one human woman can carry in her heart. Though she's now
        been granted the powers
        and lifespan of the High Fae, she is haunted by her time Under the Mountain and the terrible deeds she
        performed
        to save
        the lives of Tamlin and his people.
        <br><br>
        As her marriage to Tamlin approaches, Feyre's hollowness and nightmares consume her. She finds herself split
        into two
        different one who upholds her bargain with Rhysand, High Lord of the feared Night Court, and one who lives
        out
        her life
        in the Spring Court with Tamlin. While Feyre navigates a dark web of politics, passion, and dazzling power,
        a
        greater
        evil looms. She might just be the key to stopping it, but only if she can harness her harrowing gifts, heal
        her
        fractured soul, and decide how she wishes to shape her future-and the future of a world in turmoil.
        <br><br>
