        <u>Author:</u> <i>Kerri Maniscalco</i> <u>Originally published:</u> <i>5 October 2021</i><br><br>
        <u>About:</u>Kerri Maniscalco grew up in a semi-haunted house outside NYC where her fascination with gothic
        settings began. In her
        spare time she reads everything she can get her hands on, cooks all kinds of food with her family and
        friends,
        and
        drinks entirely too much tea while discussing life’s finer points with her cats.
        <br><br>
        <u>SUMMARY:</u>After selling her soul to become Queen of the Wicked, Emilia travels to the Seven Circles
        with
        the enigmatic Prince of
        Wrath, where she’s introduced to a seductive world of vice.
        <br>
        She vows to do whatever it takes to avenge her beloved sister, Vittoria... even if that means accepting the
        hand
        of the
        Prince of Pride, the king of demons.
        <br><br>
        The first rule in the court of the Wicked? Trust no one. With back-stabbing princes, luxurious palaces,
        mysterious party
        invitations, and conflicting clues about who really killed her twin, Emilia finds herself more alone than
        ever
        before.
        Can she even trust Wrath, her one-time ally in the mortal world... or is he keeping dangerous secrets about
        his
        true
        nature?
        <br>
        Emilia will be tested in every way as she seeks a series of magical objects that will unlock the clues of
        her
        past and
        the answers she craves...
        <br>
        One sister.
        Two sinful princes.
        Infinite deception with a side of revenge… Welcome to Hell.<br><br>
