            <u>SUMMARY:</u>When nineteen-year-old huntress Feyre kills a wolf in the woods, a terrifying creature
            arrives to
            demand
            retribution.
            Dragged to a treacherous magical land she knows about only from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is
            not
            truly a
            beast, but one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled her world.<br><br>
            At least, he’s not a beast all the time.
            <br>
            As she adapts to her new home, her feelings for the faerie, Tamlin, transform from icy hostility into a
            fiery
            passion
            that burns through every lie she’s been told about the beautiful, dangerous world of the Fae. But something
            is
            not right
            in the faerie lands. An ancient, wicked shadow is growing, and Feyre must find a way to stop it, or doom
            Tamlin—and his
            world—forever.
            <br><br>

            and

            lore into an unforgettable read.
