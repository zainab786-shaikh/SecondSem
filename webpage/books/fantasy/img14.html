        <u>SUMMARY:</u>Sarah J. Maas's brand-new CRESCENT CITY series begins with House of Earth and Blood: the
        story of
        half-Fae and
        half-human Bryce Quinlan as she seeks revenge in a contemporary fantasy world of magic, danger, and searing
        romance.
        Bryce Quinlan had the perfect life-working hard all day and partying all night-until a demon murdered her
        closest
        friends, leaving her bereft, wounded, and alone. When the accused is behind bars but the crimes start up
        again,
        Bryce
        finds herself at the heart of the investigation. She'll do whatever it takes to avenge their deaths.
        <br><br>
        Hunt Athalar is a notorious Fallen angel, now enslaved to the Archangels he once attempted to overthrow. His
        brutal
        skills and incredible strength have been set to one purpose-to assassinate his boss's enemies, no questions
        asked. But
        with a demon wreaking havoc in the city, he's offered an irresistible deal: help Bryce find the murderer,
        and
        his
        freedom will be within reach.
        <br>
        As Bryce and Hunt dig deep into Crescent City's underbelly, they discover a dark power that threatens
        everything
        and
        everyone they hold dear, and they find, in each other, a blazing passion-one that could set them both free,
        if
        they'd
        only let it.
        <br><br>
        With unforgettable characters, sizzling romance, and page-turning suspense, this richly inventive new
        fantasy
        series by
        #1 New York Times bestselling author Sarah J. Maas delves into the heartache of loss, the price of
        freedom-and
        the power
        of love.
