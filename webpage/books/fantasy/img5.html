        <u>SUMMARY:</u>Nesta Archeron has always been prickly-proud, swift to anger, and slow to forgive. And ever
        since
        being forced into the
        Cauldron and becoming High Fae against her will, she's struggled to find a place for herself within the
        strange,
        deadly
        world she inhabits. Worse, she can't seem to move past the horrors of the war with Hybern and all she lost
        in
        it.
        <br><br>
        The one person who ignites her temper more than any other is Cassian, the battle-scarred warrior whose
        position
        in
        Rhysand and Feyre's Night Court keeps him constantly in Nesta's orbit. But her temper isn't the only thing
        Cassian
        ignites. The fire between them is undeniable, and only burns hotter as they are forced into close quarters
        with
        each
        other.
        <br><br>
        Meanwhile, the treacherous human queens who returned to the Continent during the last war have forged a
        dangerous new
        alliance, threatening the fragile peace that has settled over the realms. And the key to halting them might
        very
        well
        rely on Cassian and Nesta facing their haunting pasts.
        <br>
        Against the sweeping backdrop of a world seared by war and plagued with uncertainty, Nesta and Cassian
        battle
        monsters
        from within and without as they search for acceptance-and healing-in each other's arms. <br><br>
