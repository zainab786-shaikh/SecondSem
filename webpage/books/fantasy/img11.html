            <u>Author:</u> <i>Kerri Maniscalco</i> <u>Originally published:</u> <i>27 September 2022</i><br><br>
            <u>About:</u>Kerri Maniscalco grew up in a semi-haunted house outside NYC where her fascination with gothic
            settings began. In her
            spare time she reads everything she can get her hands on, cooks all kinds of food with her family and
            friends,
            and
            drinks entirely too much tea while discussing life‚Äôs finer points with her cats.
            <br><br>
            <u>SUMMARY:</u>Emilia is reeling from the shocking discovery that her twin sister, Vittoria, is alive. But
            before she faces the demons
            of her past, Emilia yearns to claim her king, the seductive Prince of Wrath, in the flesh. Emilia doesn‚Äôt
            simply
            desire
            his body, she wants his heart and soul‚Äîbut that‚Äôs something the enigmatic demon can‚Äôt promise her.
            <br><br>
            When a high-ranking member of House Greed is assassinated, Emilia and Wrath are drawn to the rival demon
            court.
            Damning
            evidence points to Vittoria as the murderer and she‚Äôs quickly declared an enemy of the Seven Circles.
            Despite
            her
            betrayal, Emilia will do anything to solve this new mystery and find out who her sister really is.
            Together Emilia and Wrath play a sin-fueled game of deception as they work to stop the unrest that‚Äôs brewing
            between
            witches, demons, shape-shifters and the most treacherous foes of all: the Feared.
            <br><br>
            Emilia was warned that when it came to the Wicked nothing was as it seemed. But, have the true villains been
            much closer
            all along? When the truth is finally revealed, it just might end up costing Emilia her heart.
            Two curses.<br>
            One prophecy.<br>
            A reckoning all have feared.
            <br><br>
            And a love more powerful than fate. All hail the king and queen of Hell.<br><br>
