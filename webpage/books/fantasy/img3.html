            <u>SUMMARY:</u>Feyre has returned to the Spring Court, determined to gather information on Tamlin's actions
            and
            learn what she can
            about the invading king threatening to bring her land to its knees. But to do so she must play a deadly game
            of
            deceit.
            One slip could bring doom not only for Feyre, but for everything-and everyone-she holds dear.
            <br><br>
            As war bears down upon them all, Feyre endeavors to take her place amongst the High Fae of the land,
            balancing
            her
            struggle to master her powers-both magical and political-and her love for her court and family. Amidst these
            struggles,
            Feyre and Rhysand must decide whom to trust amongst the cunning and lethal High Lords, and hunt for allies
            in
            unexpected
            places.
