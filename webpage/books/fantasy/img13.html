        <u>About:</u>Shelby Mahurin grew up on a small farm in rural Indiana, where sticks became wands and cows
        became
        dragons. Her rampant
        imagination didn't fade with age, so she continues to play make-believe every day—with words now instead of
        cows. When
        not writing, Shelby watches the Office and obsesses over her Twitter feed.
        <br><br>
        <u>SUMMARY:</u>Bound as one to love, honor, or burn.
        Two years ago, Louise le Blanc fled her coven and took shelter in the city of Cesarine, forsaking all magic
        and
        living
        off whatever she could steal. There, witches like Lou are hunted. They are feared. And they are burned.
        <br><br>
        Sworn to the Church as a Chasseur, Reid Diggory has lived his life by one principle: thou shalt not suffer a
        witch to
        live. His path was never meant to cross with Lou's, but a wicked stunt forces them into an impossible
        union—holy
        matrimony.
        <br><br>
        The war between witches and Church is an ancient one, and Lou's most dangerous enemies bring a fate worse
        than
        fire.
        Unable to ignore her growing feelings, yet powerless to change what she is, a choice must be made.
        And love makes fools of us all.
