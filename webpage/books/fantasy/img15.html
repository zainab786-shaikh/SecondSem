        <u>SUMMARY:</u>Bryce Quinlan and Hunt Athalar are trying to get back to normal―they may have saved Crescent
        City, but with so much
        upheaval in their lives lately, they mostly want a chance to relax. Slow down. Figure out what the future
        holds.
        <br><br>
        The Asteri have kept their word so far, leaving Bryce and Hunt alone. But with the rebels chipping away at
        the
        Asteri’s
        power, the threat the rulers pose is growing. As Bryce, Hunt, and their friends get pulled into the rebels’
        plans, the
        choice becomes clear: stay silent while others are oppressed, or fight for what’s right. And they’ve never
        been
        very
        good at staying silent.
        <br><br>
        In this sexy, action-packed sequel to the #1 bestseller House of Earth and Blood, Sarah J. Maas weaves a
        captivating
        story of a world about to explode―and the people who will do anything to save it.
