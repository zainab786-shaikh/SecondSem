            <u>SUMMARY:</u>Kaz Brekker and his crew of deadly outcasts have just pulled off a heist so daring even they
            didn't think they'd
            survive. But instead of divvying up a fat reward, they're right back to fighting for their lives.
            <br><br>
            Double-crossed and badly weakened, the crew is low on resources, allies, and hope. As powerful forces from
            around the
            world descend on Ketterdam to root out the secrets of the dangerous drug known as jurda parem, old rivals
            and
            new
            enemies emerge to challenge Kaz's cunning and test the team's fragile loyalties.
            A war will be waged on the city's dark and twisting streets - a battle for revenge and redemption that will
            decide the
            fate of the Grisha world. <br><br>
