        <u>About:</u>Margaret writes fantasy for young adult readers. She lives near Cincinnati, Ohio, and when
        she's
        not reading or writing
        she enjoys drawing, watching documentaries, making pudding, gaming, and exploring the outdoors in search of
        toads and
        mushrooms.
        <br><br>
        <u>SUMMARY:</u>All sorcerers are evil. Elisabeth has known that as long as she has known anything. Raised as
        a
        foundling in one of
        Austermeer’s Great Libraries, Elisabeth has grown up among the tools of sorcery—magical grimoires that
        whisper
        on
        shelves and rattle beneath iron chains. If provoked, they transform into grotesque monsters of ink and
        leather.
        She
        hopes to become a warden, charged with protecting the kingdom from their power.
        <br><br>
        Then an act of sabotage releases the library’s most dangerous grimoire. Elisabeth’s desperate intervention
        implicates
        her in the crime, and she is torn from her home to face justice in the capital. With no one to turn to but
        her
        sworn
        enemy, the sorcerer Nathaniel Thorn, and his mysterious demonic servant, she finds herself entangled in a
        centuries-old
        conspiracy. Not only could the Great Libraries go up in flames, but the world along with them.
        <br><br>
        As her alliance with Nathaniel grows stronger, Elisabeth starts to question everything she’s been
        taught—about
        sorcerers, about the libraries she loves, even about herself. For Elisabeth has a power she has never
        guessed,
        and a
        future she could never have imagined.<br><br>
