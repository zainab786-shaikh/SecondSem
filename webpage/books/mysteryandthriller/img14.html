			<b>Author:</b> <i> Gillian Flynn<br></i> <br><b>Date of publish:</b> <i>26 September 2006</i><br><br>
			<b>ABOUT:</b><br> Sharp Objects is the 2006 debut novel by American author Gillian Flynn. The book was first
			published through Shaye Areheart Books
			on September 26, 2006, and has subsequently been re-printed through Broadway Books. The novel follows
			Camille
			Preaker,
			a newspaper journalist who must return to her hometown to report on a series of brutal murders.
			<br><br><br> <b> SUMMARY:</b><br>
			Camille Preaker works as a journalist at The Daily Post, a small newspaper in Chicago. She is not
			particularly
			satisfied with the job, which
			includes writing stories about human neglect, murders, and crime. Camille gets along somewhat well with her
			boss
			Frank Curry, who supporte
			d her during a recent hospitalization due to self-harm. Camille has carved many words onto her body—having
			previously hallucinated them
			on her skin. Curry gives her a reporting assignment to her hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri, where one girl
			has
			been murdered and a second is missing.
			<br><br>
			Once in Wind Gap, Camille manages to gain some information about the crimes from the townspeople, including
			the
			family of Ann Nash, the murdered g
			irl. The local police are not particularly forthcoming about the murder, but the town sheriff, Chief
			Vickery,
			divulges to Camille off the record t
			hat he believes that the murderer is a Wind Gap native, not a stranger. Soon the body of the missing girl,
			Natalie Keene, is discovered in a
			n alley in town. Both she and Ann were strangled and had all of their teeth removed. The police are baffled
			by
			the crimes. Camille publishes a stor
			y, only for Curry to ask her to remain in Wind Gap for further coverage of the murders.
			<br><br>
			While there, Camille reconnects with her estranged mother Adora and 13-year-old half-sister Amma. Camille
			never
			had a good relation
			ship with her mother, as Adora always preferred Camille's younger sister Marian, who died due to an
			unspecified
			illness when Camille was young.
			Amma, who was born after Marian's death, has grown into a spoiled teen who behaves like a young child in
			front
			of her mother to hide her drinking,
			drug use, and promiscuity. Camille connects with a handsome Kansas City detective, Richard Willis, sent to
			investigate the potential of a serial killer.
			<br><br>
			As Camille continues to investigate, she begins a sexual relationship with Richard. During each encounter
			with
			him, Camille refuses to remove her clothe
			s out of fear that he will reject her after he sees her scars. Camille and Amma begin to grow closer. After
			attending a party with her sister where the two
			of them get drunk and take drugs, Camille wakes to find Adora caring for her, giving her pills that make her
			sick. Camille is horrified to discover that Adora
			does this to Amma frequently, and realizes that Marian's illness was not hers, but Adora's—Münchausen
			syndrome
			by proxy. After some investigation, Camille
			finds a letter written by a nurse caring for Marian that shows that the nurse had these same suspicions.
			Camille
			also discovers that Richard believes Adora
			to be responsible for the murders of Ann and Natalie. She returns to her mother's home, where Adora poisons
			Camille and tries to care for Camille's wounds while bathing her.
			<br><br>
			Camille passes out, but awakens to find Richard and the police arresting her mother. Richard is horrified to
			see
			the extent of her scars
			. This ends their relationship, despite his earlier claims of genuinely falling for her. Adora is charged
			with
			the murders of Marian and the two girls, and Amma
			is sent to Chicago to live with Camille. Amma initially seems to be healing from the abuse she suffered at
			Adora's hands, but soon after she begins attending
			a girls' school in Chicago, a classmate is discovered murdered, having had six of her teeth pulled. It is
			then
			revealed that while Adora did kill Marian, Amma
			murdered Ann Nash and Natalie Keene, in part because she was jealous of the attention Adora was giving the
			girls. Amma is later arrested for her crimes. Distraught
			, Camille cuts herself again, but is stopped by Curry and his wife, who take her in as their own daughter.
			The
			story ends with Camille learning to be cared for as a child
			and a daughter for the first time.
