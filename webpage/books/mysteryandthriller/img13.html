			<b>ABOUT:</b><br>
			The Silence of the Lambs is a 1988 psychological horror novel by Thomas Harris. It is the sequel to Harris's
			1981 novel Red Dragon.
			Both novels feature the cannibalistic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter, this time pitted against FBI
			Special
			Agent Clarice Starling.
			Its film adaptation directed by Jonathan Demme was released in 1991 to widespread critical acclaim and box
			office success.
			It won the Academy Award for Best Picture.<br><br><b>SUMMARYS:</b><br>
			<div>
				Clarice Starling, a young FBI trainee, is asked to carry out an errand by Jack Crawford, the head of the
				FBI
				division that draws up psychological profiles of serial
				killers. Starling is to present a questionnaire to the brilliant forensic psychiatrist and cannibalistic
				serial
				killer, Hannibal Lecter. Lecter is serving nine consecutive
				life sentences in a Maryland mental institution for a series of murders.
				<br><br>
				Crawford's real intention, however, is to try to solicit Lecter's assistance in the hunt for a serial
				killer
				dubbed "Buffalo Bill", whose M.O. involves kidnapping large
				women, starving them for up to two weeks, killing and skinning them, and dumping the remains in nearby
				rivers.
				The nickname was started by Kansas City Homicide
				as a sick joke that "he likes to skin his humps." Throughout the investigation, Starling periodically
				returns to
				Lecter in search of information, and the two form a strange
				relationship in which he offers her cryptic clues in return for information about her troubled and bleak
				childhood as an orphan.
				<br><br>
				When Bill's sixth victim is found in West Virginia, Starling helps Crawford perform the autopsy.
				Starling
				finds
				a pupa in the throat of the victim, and just as Lecter predicted,
				she has been scalped. Triangular patches of skin have also been taken from her shoulders. Furthermore,
				autopsy
				reports indicate that Bill had killed her within four days
				of her capture, much faster than his earlier victims. Starling takes the pupa to the Smithsonian, where
				it
				is
				initially identified as the black witch moth, a species that does
				not naturally occur where the victim was found, though later it is identified as the Death's-head Moth,
				an
				even
				more exotic species that would have to be reared in
				captivity from imported eggs.
				<br><br>
				On the basis of Lecter's prediction, Starling believes that he knows who Buffalo Bill really is. She
				asks
				Crawford why she was sent to fish for information on Buffalo Bill without
				being told she was doing so; Crawford claims that if she had had an agenda, Lecter would have sensed it
				and
				never spoken up.
				<br><br>
				In Tennessee, Catherine Baker Martin, daughter of Senator Ruth Martin, is kidnapped. Within six hours,
				her
				blouse is found on the roadside, slit up the back: Buffalo Bill's calling
				card. He traps her in an oubliette and begins to starve her. Crawford is advised that no less than the
				President
				of the United States has expressed "intense interest" in the case,
				and that a successful rescue is preferable. Crawford estimates they have three days before Catherine is
				killed.
				Starling is sent to Lecter with the offer of a deal: if he assists in
				Catherine's rescue and Buffalo Bill's capture, he will be transferred out of the asylum, something he
				has
				continually longed for. Lecter expresses skepticism at the genuineness of the offer,
				but he does not believe that Starling would intentionally lie to him.
				<br><br>
				After Starling leaves, Lecter reminisces on the past, recalling a conversation with Benjamin Raspail, a
				former
				patient whom he had eventually murdered. During therapy sessions,
				Raspail told Lecter about a former lover, Jame Gumb: After Raspail left Gumb and began dating a sailor
				named
				Klaus, Gumb became jealous and murdered Klaus, using his skin to
				make an apron. Raspail also revealed that Gumb had an epiphany upon watching a butterfly hatch.
				<br><br>
				Lecter's ruminations are interrupted when Dr. Frederick Chilton—the asylum's administrator and Lecter's
				self-styled nemesis—steps in. A listening device allowed him to record
				Starling's offer, and Chilton has found out that Crawford's deal is a lie. He offers one of his own: If
				Lecter
				reveals Buffalo Bill's identity, he will indeed get a transfer to another
				asylum, but only if Chilton gets credit for getting the information from him. Lecter agrees, but insists
				that he
				be allowed to give the information to Senator Martin in person, in Tennessee.
				Unbeknown to Chilton, Lecter has secretly collected the ingredients for an improvised handcuff lockpick,
				which
				he deduces will be useful at some point during the travel.
				<br><br>
				In Tennessee, Lecter toys with Senator Martin briefly, enjoying the woman's anguish, but eventually
				gives
				her
				some information about Buffalo Bill: his name is William
				"Billy" Rubin, and he has suffered from "elephant ivory anthrax", a knifemaker's disease. He also
				provides
				an
				accurate physical description. The name, however, is a red
				herring: bilirubin is a pigment in human bile and a chief coloring agent in human feces, which the
				forensic
				lab
				compares to the color of Chilton's hair.
				<br><br>
				Starling tries one last time to get information from Lecter as he is held in police custody. He offers a
				final
				clue—"we covet what we see every day"—and demands to hear her
				worst memory. Starling reveals that, after her father's death, she was sent to live with a cousin on a
				sheep
				and
				horse ranch. One night, she discovered the farmer slaughtering
				the spring lambs, and fled in terror with a mare also destined for the slaughterhouse whom she named
				Hannah.
				The
				farmer caught her and sent her to an orphanage, where she
				spent the rest of her childhood. Lecter, seeing the parallels between the helpless lambs and the equally
				helpless Catherine, thanks her for her candor, and the two share a brief
				moment of connection before Chilton forces her to leave. Shortly after this, Lecter escapes by killing
				and
				eviscerating his guards, using one of their faces as a mask to fool paramedics.
				<br><br>
				Starling continues her search for Buffalo Bill, deducing that he knew his first victim, Fredrica Bimmel,
				from
				everyday life. She visits Fredrica's family home and discovers that both she
				and Buffalo Bill were accomplished tailors and is killing the women in order to make a 'suit' for
				himself,
				having come to believe he was transsexual despite this self-diagnosis
				consistently being deemed false by doctors, causing him to be rejected for sexual reassignment surgery
				by
				multiple hospitals. By canvassing Bimmel's known associates, she ends
				up at the house of one Jame Gumb, a dressmaker and leatherworker. She spies a Death's-head moth in his
				home
				and
				knows whom she has found; however, Gumb escapes into his
				basement. Starling, armed only with a revolver but aware that calling for backup will result in
				Catherine's
				death, follows him down, and kills him after a protracted chase. Catherine
				is returned to her family physically unharmed.
				<br><br>
				Lecter then writes a congratulatory letter to Starling, in which he hopes that "the lambs have stopped
				screaming" and indicates that he has no plans to pursue her. He also predicts
				correctly that saving Catherine Martin may have granted Clarice some relief, but that the silence will
				never
				become eternal, heralding her motives for a continued career at the FBI.
				The novel ends with Clarice sleeping peacefully "in the silence of the lambs".
