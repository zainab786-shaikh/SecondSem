		<b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
		"The Girl on the Train" is a gripping psychological thriller novel by Paula Hawkins, which was published in
		2015. The story is told from the perspectives of three different women: Rachel Watson, Anna, and Megan.
		<br><br>
		Rachel Watson is the main protagonist of the story. She is an alcoholic who takes the train to London every
		day.
		During her daily journey, she often observes a couple living in a house near the tracks, whom she calls
		"Jess
		and Jason." She becomes obsessed with their seemingly perfect life and starts to fantasize about their
		relationship. However, one day she witnesses something shocking while on the train and becomes determined to
		find out what happened to Jess.
		<br><br>
		Anna is Rachel's ex-husband Tom's new wife, and she is now living in the house that Rachel used to share
		with
		Tom. Rachel is bitter about their relationship and becomes increasingly jealous of Anna. She also feels
		threatened by Anna's bond with Rachel's former husband and becomes desperate to find a way to disrupt their
		relationship.
		<br><br>
		Megan Hipwell is the missing woman whom Rachel was observing from the train. She was having an affair with
		Tom
		and has secrets of her own. She appears to be unhappy in her marriage and is grappling with various personal
		issues.
		<br><br>
		As the story progresses, the reader learns that Rachel's alcoholism has caused her to have frequent
		blackouts,
		and her memories are unreliable. She becomes more involved in the lives of the people she is observing and
		starts to uncover the truth about Megan's disappearance.
		<br><br>
		It is revealed that Tom is abusive and controlling towards his partners, and Megan was trying to leave him.
		In a
		drunken blackout, Rachel had confronted Tom and Megan, and in a struggle, she had accidentally killed Megan.
		Tom
		had then manipulated Rachel's memories to make her believe that she was responsible for Megan's death, as he
		was
		afraid of being caught.
		<br><br>
		In the end, Rachel and Anna team up to confront Tom and expose his lies. Rachel starts to take control of
		her
		alcohol addiction and moves on with her life, while Tom is arrested for Megan's murder.
		<br><br>
		Overall, "The Girl on the Train" is a thrilling and suspenseful novel that delves into complex themes such
		as
		addiction, memory, and domestic abuse. The book was a commercial success and was adapted into a movie in
		2016.
		The film starred Emily Blunt as Rachel and was also well-received by audiences and critics alike.
