		<b>ABOUT:</b><br>
		"The Outsiders" is a classic young adult novel written by S.E. Hinton, first published in 1967. The novel
		follows the story of Ponyboy Curtis, a teenage boy from a poor family who becomes involved in a violent
		conflict
		between rival groups, the Greasers and the Socs, in his hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Through Ponyboy's eyes,
		the
		novel explores themes of class, identity, family, and loyalty, and has been widely acclaimed for its vivid
		characters, gripping plot, and poignant portrayal of teenage life.
		<br><br><b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
		Ponyboy Curtis, a fourteen year old boy who is a member of a "gang of "greasers", is leaving a movie theater
		when he is jumped by "Socs", the greasers' rival gang. Several greasers, including Ponyboy's two older
		brothers—the paternal Darry and the popular Sodapop—come to his rescue. The next night, Ponyboy and two
		greaser
		friends, the hardened Dally and the quiet Johnny, meet Cherry and Marcia, a pair of Soc girls, at a drive-in
		movie theater. Cherry scorns Dally's rude advances, but Ponyboy speaks civilly with Cherry, emotionally
		connecting with a Soc for the first time in his life.
		<br><br>
		Afterward, Ponyboy, Johnny, and their wisecracking friend Two-Bit begin to walk Cherry and Marcia home, when
		they are stopped by Cherry's boyfriend Bob, who badly beat up Johnny a few months back. Bob and the greasers
		exchange taunts, but Cherry prevents a fight by willingly leaving with Bob. Ponyboy gets home at two in the
		morning, enraging Darry until he suddenly slaps Ponyboy. Pony runs out the door and meets up with Johnny,
		expressing his anger at Darry's increasing coldness in the wake of his parents' recent deaths in a car
		crash.
		<br><br>
		Running away from home, Ponyboy and Johnny wander into a park, where Bob and four other Socs surround them.
		After some heated talk, Ponyboy spits at the Socs, prompting them to attempt to drown him in a nearby
		fountain,
		but Johnny stabs Bob, killing him and dispersing the rest. Terrified as to what to do next, Ponyboy and
		Johnny
		rush to find Dally, who gives them money and a loaded gun, directing them to hide in an abandoned church in
		Windrixville. During their stay there, Pony cuts and dyes his hair as a disguise, reads Gone with the Wind
		to
		Johnny, and, upon viewing a beautiful sunrise, recites the poem "Nothing Gold Can Stay" by Robert Frost.
		<br><br>
		Days later, Dally comes to check on them, revealing that violence between the greasers and Socs has
		escalated
		since Bob's death into all-out city-wide warfare, with Cherry acting out of guilt as a spy for the greasers.
		Johnny decides to turn himself in and Dally agrees to take the boys back home. As they attempt to leave,
		they
		notice the church has caught fire and several local schoolchildren have become trapped inside. The greasers
		run
		inside the burning church to save the children, but Ponyboy is rendered unconscious by the fumes. At the
		hospital he discovers that he and Dally are not badly injured, but a piece of the church roof fell on Johnny
		and
		broke his back. Sodapop and Darry come to the hospital; Darry breaks down and cries. Ponyboy then realizes
		that
		Darry cares about him, and is only hard on him because he loves him and cares about his future.
		<br><br>
		The following morning the newspapers declare Pony and Johnny heroes, but Johnny will be charged with
		manslaughter for Bob's death. Two-Bit tells them that the greaser–Soc rivalry is to be settled in a final
		rumble. Ponyboy and Two-Bit are approached by a Soc named Randy, Bob's best friend, who expresses remorse
		for
		his involvement in the gang war, lacks confidence about the rumble ending the feud, and says he will not
		participate.
		<br><br>
		Later, Ponyboy visits Johnny at the hospital, where he is in critical condition. On their way home, Pony
		spots
		Cherry and they talk. Cherry says she is unwilling to visit Johnny in the hospital because he killed her
		boyfriend. Pony calls her a traitor, but after she explains herself they end on good terms. After escaping
		the
		hospital, Dally shows up just in time for the rumble. The greasers win the brutal fight. Afterward, Pony and
		Dally hurry back to the hospital to see Johnny, but he dies moments later and a maniacal Dally runs out of
		the
		room. Pony returns home that night feeling confused and disoriented. Dally calls the house to say that he
		has
		robbed a store and is running from the police. The greasers find Dally deliberately pointing an unloaded gun
		at
		the police, causing them to shoot and kill him. Overwhelmed, Ponyboy faints and is sick in bed for many days
		due
		to the resulting concussion from the rumble. When the hearing finally comes, the judge frees Ponyboy from
		responsibility for Bob's death and allows Pony to remain at home with Darry and Soda.
		<br><br>
		Ponyboy returns to school, but his grades drop. Although he is failing English, his teacher, Mr. Syme, says
		he
		will pass him if he writes a decent theme. In the copy of Gone with the Wind that Johnny gave him before
		dying,
		Ponyboy finds a letter from Johnny describing how he will die proudly after saving the kids from the fire.
		Johnny also urges Ponyboy to "stay gold". Ponyboy decides to write his English assignment about the recent
		events, and begins his essay with the opening line of the novel: "When I stepped out into the bright
		sunlight
		from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home.
