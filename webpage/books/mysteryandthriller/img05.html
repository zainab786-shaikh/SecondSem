		<br><br><b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
		"The Guest List" is a suspenseful and thrilling novel written by Lucy Foley. The story takes place on a
		remote
		island off the coast of Ireland, where a glamorous wedding is taking place between a magazine
		publisher named Jules and a rising TV star named Will.
		<br><br>
		The novel is narrated from the perspectives of five different characters, all of whom are attending the
		wedding.
		Jules is the bride, and she is portrayed as a strong, successful, and ambitious woman who
		is deeply in love with her fianc√©. Hannah, her best friend, is the maid of honor and has a complicated
		history
		with Will, the groom. Johnno is Will's childhood friend and is the best man at the wedding.
		Olivia is the wedding planner and has her own hidden agenda, while Aiofe is a resident of the island and has
		her
		own connection to the bride and groom.
		<br><br>
		The novel is structured so that each chapter is told from the perspective of a different character, which
		allows
		the reader to gain insight into each character's thoughts, feelings, and motivations. The novel
		starts with Jules' perspective, as she arrives on the island, full of excitement and anticipation for her
		big
		day. However, as the novel progresses, tensions begin to rise among the guests, and secrets are revealed.
		<br><br>
		Hannah, for example, is struggling to come to terms with her feelings for Will, and this puts a strain on
		her
		relationship with Jules. Johnno, meanwhile, is dealing with his own personal demons, and his past
		comes back to haunt him. Olivia, the wedding planner, is also hiding something, and her motives for being on
		the
		island are called into question.
		<br><br>
		As the novel progresses, the characters become increasingly suspicious of each other, and the atmosphere on
		the
		island becomes tense and foreboding. The storm hits the island, cutting off communication
		with the outside world and leaving the guests stranded. Soon after, a murder occurs, and everyone becomes a
		suspect.
		<br><br>
		The author skillfully weaves together the perspectives of the five different characters, creating a rich and
		complex narrative that delves into themes of love, betrayal, and revenge. Each character's perspective
		reveals a new layer of the story, and the tension and suspense continue to build throughout the novel.
		<br><br>
		Through each character's perspective, the novel explores the complicated relationships and hidden
		motivations of
		the guests, as well as the events that led up to the murder. The narrative is fast-paced,
		filled with suspense, and keeps the reader guessing until the very end.
		<br><br>
		Overall, "The Guest List" is a gripping thriller that will keep readers on the edge of their seats. The
		author's
		skillful use of multiple perspectives, combined with a well-crafted plot and engaging characters,
		makes for an entertaining and suspenseful read.
