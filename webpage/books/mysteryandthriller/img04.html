			<div>
				"My Sister, the Serial Killer" is a fascinating and thought-provoking novel that explores complex issues
				such as
				loyalty, family, and the consequences of one's actions. The book, written
				by Oyinkan Braithwaite and published in 2018, takes place in Lagos, Nigeria, and follows the story of
				two
				sisters, Korede and Ayoola.
				<br><br>
				The novel opens with Korede receiving a call from her sister Ayoola, who has just killed her third
				boyfriend
				in
				self-defense. Korede, who is a practical and responsible nurse, rushes
				to the scene to help her sister dispose of the body and cover up the crime. This has become a familiar
				routine
				for Korede, who has helped her sister cover up her murders in the past, but this time, things are
				different.
				Ayoola sets her sights on Tade, a doctor at the hospital where Korede works and the man Korede secretly
				loves.
				Korede is forced to make a difficult decision: should she continue to cover up her sister's crimes or
				risk
				everything to protect the man she loves?
				<br><br>
				One of the strengths of "My Sister, the Serial Killer" is the unique perspective from which the story is
				told.
				The novel is narrated by Korede, who is a compelling and complex character.
				As the older sister, Korede feels responsible for Ayoola, even though she is troubled by her sister's
				behavior.
				Throughout the book, we see Korede struggle with her loyalty to her sister
				and her growing sense of guilt and responsibility for the crimes they have committed. Korede's voice is
				strong
				and distinctive, and the reader is immediately drawn into her world and her struggles.
				<br><br>
				In addition to exploring the relationship between the sisters, "My Sister, the Serial Killer" also
				touches
				on
				larger societal issues. The novel sheds light on the treatment of women in
				Nigeria, particularly the prevalence of violence against them. Through the lens of the sisters'
				relationship,
				Braithwaite highlights the ways in which women are often pitted against each
				other and the struggles they face in a patriarchal society. This adds an extra layer of depth and
				complexity
				to
				the novel, making it not only an entertaining read but also a thought-provoking one.
				<br><br>
				Despite the dark subject matter, "My Sister, the Serial Killer" is infused with humor and wit, making
				for an
				engaging and entertaining read. Braithwaite's writing is sharp and clever, and
				she has a talent for balancing serious subject matter with moments of levity. The novel is a quick read,
				but
				it
				leaves a lasting impression on the reader, thanks in part to its memorable
				characters and its unique perspective on the nature of family and loyalty.
				<br><br>
				In conclusion, "My Sister, the Serial Killer" is a captivating and thought-provoking novel that combines
				dark
				humor, social commentary, and a compelling narrative to create a unique and
				memorable reading experience. Through the story of two sisters, the novel explores complex issues such
				as
				family
				dynamics, the treatment of women, and the consequences of one's actions.
				It is a book that will keep you engaged from beginning to end, and one that will stay with you long
				after

				finished reading.
