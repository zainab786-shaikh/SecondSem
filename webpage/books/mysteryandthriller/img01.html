		<b>ABOUT:</b><br>
		Natasha, Riya, Anjali and Katherine were best friends in college—each different from the other yet
		inseparable—until that night.
		It was the night that began with a bottle of whisky and a game of Ouija but ended with the death of Sania,
		their
		unlikeable hostel mate. The friends had vowed never to discuss that
		fateful night, a pact that kept their friendship and guilt dormant for the last twenty years.
		<br><br>
		But now, someone has begun to mess with them, threatening to reveal the truth that only Sania knew. Is it a
		hacker playing on their guilt, or has Sania's ghost really returned to avenge her death?
		As the faceless enemy closes in on them, the friends come together once again to recount what really
		happened
		that night. But when the story is retold by each of them,
		the pieces don't match. Because none of them is telling the whole truth . . .
		<br><br>
		That Night is a dark, twisted tale of friendship and betrayal that draws you in and confounds you at every
		turn.
		<br><br>

		<b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
		"That Night" by Nidhi Upadhyay is a novel that tells the story of two childhood friends, Avinash and
		Raveena,
		who are separated by circumstances but are brought back together by fate.
		The novel explores themes of love, loss, redemption, and the power of forgiveness.
		<br><br>
		The story begins with Avinash, a successful entrepreneur, receiving a phone call from Raveena after fifteen
		years. She is now a successful fashion designer in New York and is back in
		India to showcase her latest collection. Avinash is surprised and excited to hear from her after all these
		years, and they plan to meet at a party that evening.
		<br><br>
		As Avinash prepares to meet Raveena, he reminisces about their childhood memories and the bond they shared.
		However, their reunion is not as smooth as he had hoped, and
		they find themselves confronted by their painful past. The story alternates between the present and
		flashbacks
		to their childhood, where we learn about the events that led to their separation.
		<br><br>
		Avinash and Raveena had been inseparable as children, spending all their time together, sharing their joys
		and
		sorrows. However, their friendship was tested when Avinash's father,
		a powerful politician, was involved in a scandal that ruined his family's reputation. Raveena's family, who
		were
		close to Avinash's family, distanced themselves from them, and Raveena
		and her mother moved away. This left Avinash feeling abandoned and betrayed by Raveena, who he felt had
		chosen
		her family over him.
		<br><br>
		As Avinash and Raveena reconnect, they confront the emotions and unresolved issues that have haunted them
		for
		years. They realize that they have both been carrying the weight of their past
		and need to confront it to move forward. They struggle to come to terms with their feelings for each other
		and
		the secrets that they have been keeping from each other.
		<br><br>
		The author does an excellent job of exploring the theme of forgiveness in "That Night". Forgiveness is a
		powerful tool that can help heal old wounds and mend broken relationships. Avinash
		and Raveena learn to forgive each other for the mistakes they made in the past and move forward to rebuild
		their
		friendship.
		<br><br>
		Overall, "That Night" is a poignant and compelling story that will resonate with readers who have
		experienced
		the pain of lost friendships and the power of forgiveness. The author's
		writing is evocative and heartfelt, and the characters are well-drawn and relatable. If you are looking for
		a
		novel that explores the complexities of human relationships and the healing
		power of forgiveness, "That Night" is a must-read.
