		<b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
		"Let the Right One In" is a novel that explores the themes of loneliness, love, and the search for
		connection,
		set against the backdrop of a horror story. The story follows a young boy named Oskar, who lives in a suburb
		of
		Stockholm in the early 1980s. Oskar is a lonely child who is bullied at school and lives with his divorced
		mother. He spends his free time reading about serial killers and dreaming of revenge against his bullies.
		<br><br>
		One day, a new girl named Eli moves in next door, and Oskar becomes fascinated by her. Eli is a strange and
		reclusive child who only comes out at night, and she seems to have an unusual thirst for blood. Oskar is
		both
		frightened and drawn to her, and they begin to develop a close friendship.
		<br><br>
		As their friendship deepens, Oskar learns that Eli is a vampire who has been forced to live as a child
		forever.
		Eli needs to drink blood to survive, and she is pursued by a man named Håkan, who provides her with victims.
		Håkan is in love with Eli, but he is aging and unable to continue his duties as her protector.
		<br><br>
		Meanwhile, a series of gruesome murders takes place in the town, and Oskar begins to suspect that Eli may be
		involved. He also learns that Eli is not a young girl at all, but a centuries-old vampire who has been
		forced to
		live as a child forever. Despite this revelation, Oskar continues to be drawn to Eli and their friendship
		deepens.
		<br><br>
		As the story progresses, Oskar and Eli's relationship becomes more complex, and they must navigate the
		dangers
		of being vampires in a world that doesn't understand them. Oskar is torn between his love for Eli and his
		fear
		of what she is capable of, while Eli struggles to reconcile her desire for human connection with her need
		for
		blood.
		<br><br>
		In the end, Oskar and Eli are forced to confront their own mortality and the true nature of their
		relationship.
		The novel deals with themes of love, loneliness, and the search for connection, as well as the horrors of
		violence and death. It has been praised for its atmospheric writing and its ability to blend horror with
		moments
		of tenderness and empathy for its characters.
