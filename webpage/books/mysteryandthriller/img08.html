			<br><br><br> <b> SUMMARY:</b><br>
			"Gone Girl" is a thriller novel by Gillian Flynn, first published in 2012. The story is divided into three
			parts, with alternating chapters told from the perspective
			of the two main characters, Nick Dunne and his wife Amy Elliott Dunne.
			<br><br>
			Part One, "Boy Loses Girl," introduces the reader to Nick Dunne, a former magazine writer who has moved with
			his
			wife Amy from New York City to Nick's hometown
			of North Carthage, Missouri, after both lose their jobs in the economic downturn. On the morning of their
			fifth
			wedding anniversary, Nick comes home to find signs
			of a struggle and his wife missing. The police investigate and soon discover evidence that Nick may have had
			a
			role in Amy's disappearance.
			<br><br>
			Part Two, "Boy Meets Girl," reveals the story of Nick and Amy's courtship and marriage through Amy's diary
			entries. The reader learns that Amy had
			grown unhappy in her marriage and had been planning for months to fake her own disappearance and frame Nick
			for
			her murder. She had been
			secretly stashing money away and had even bought a gun, which she plans to plant in Nick's house to further
			incriminate him.
			<br><br>
			Part Three, "Boy Gets Girl Back (Or Vice Versa)," follows the aftermath of Amy's reappearance and the
			unraveling
			of her elaborate scheme.
			Nick, who had been having an affair, must work to clear his name and prove his innocence while Amy tries to
			maintain her façade and convince
			the public of her victimization. The novel takes several surprising turns as the two protagonists manipulate
			each other and those around them to achieve their own goals.
			<br><br>
			In the end, the reader is left to question the true nature of Nick and Amy's relationship, and whether they
			are
			truly happy or simply staying together
			out of mutual obsession and fear.
