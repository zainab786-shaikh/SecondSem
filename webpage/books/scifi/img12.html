		<b>ABOUT:</b><br>
		"The Time Machine" is a science fiction novella by H.G. Wells, first published in 1895. The book tells the story
		of a scientist, known only as "the Time Traveler," who builds a machine that can transport him through time. He
		travels to the future and discovers a world that is both fascinating and terrifying.
		<br><br>
		In the future, the Time Traveler encounters two distinct species of humanity: the Eloi and the Morlocks. The
		Eloi are small, childlike beings who live a carefree existence in a beautiful world without work or hardship.
		The Morlocks, on the other hand, are pale, brutish creatures who live underground and come out at night to prey
		on the Eloi.
		<br><br>
		The Time Traveler tries to understand this strange new world and to discover how it came to be. He becomes
		particularly attached to an Eloi woman named Weena and tries to protect her from the Morlocks.
		<br><br>
		As he delves deeper into the future society, the Time Traveler realizes that the two species of humanity are the
		result of a profound social and economic divide. The Eloi are the descendants of the wealthy ruling class, who
		have grown lazy and complacent over time. The Morlocks, on the other hand, are the descendants of the working
		class, who have been driven underground and forced to adapt to a life of darkness and danger.
		<br><br>
		The Time Traveler ultimately manages to escape back to his own time, but his experiences in the future leave him
		with a deep sense of unease about the course of human history. The book is a thought-provoking exploration of
		the human condition, and a warning about the dangers of complacency and social inequality.
		<br><br><b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
	<p>
		"The Time Machine" is a science fiction novella by H.G. Wells, first published in 1895. The book is considered a
		classic of the science fiction genre and has inspired numerous adaptations in film, television, and other media.
		The novella explores the themes of time travel, evolution, and the human condition.
		<br><br>
		The story follows an unnamed protagonist, referred to only as "the Time Traveller," who invents a machine that
		can transport him through time. He uses the machine to travel far into the future, where he discovers a world
		that is vastly different from his own.
		<br><br>
		In the distant future, humanity has evolved into two distinct species: the Eloi, a childlike race that lives on
		the surface of the earth and appears to have no concept of work or industry, and the Morlocks, a brutish race
		that lives underground and preys on the Eloi.
		<br><br>
		The Time Traveller befriends a young Eloi woman named Weena and tries to understand the society in which she
		lives. He discovers that the Eloi are essentially living in a utopia, with no need to work or struggle for
		survival. However, he also discovers that their idyllic existence is maintained by the Morlocks, who provide
		them with food and other necessities in exchange for their labor.
		<br><br>
		As the Time Traveller explores this future world, he becomes increasingly concerned about the fate of humanity.
		He realizes that the Eloi are essentially a degenerate offshoot of humanity, while the Morlocks represent a
		brutal, primitive version of the same species. He also realizes that the future he has seen is not inevitable,
		but rather the result of the choices made by his own society.
		<br><br>
		In the end, the Time Traveller manages to escape from the future and return to his own time. He tries to warn
		his contemporaries about the dangers of complacency and the need to take action to prevent a similar fate for
		humanity.
		<br><br>
		Overall, "The Time Machine" is a powerful and thought-provoking work of science fiction that explores deep
		themes of time, evolution, and the human condition. It is considered a classic of the genre and has had a
		profound influence on science fiction literature and popular culture.
