            <b>ABOUT:</b><br>
            It tells the story of Valentine Michael Smith, a human who comes to Earth in early adulthood after being
            born on
            the planet Mars and raised by Martians,
            and explores his interaction with and eventual transformation of Terran culture.

            <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
            The message of this book is:<br>The Spiritual Importance of Sexuality<br>
            In his time on Earth, Mike slowly learns about his own race, and what characteristics define humankind. The
            narrator tells us early on that the single most important
            difference between human beings and Martians is that Martians lack bipolar (male/female) sexuality.The story
            of
            Stranger focuses on Mike's life, so it naturally ends
            with Mike's death. But the inclusion of that last chapter in the afterlife suggests that the story will
            continue
            for eons to come.Camus argues that the only certain thing
            in life is the inevitability of death, and, because all humans will eventually meet death, all lives are all
            equally meaningless.
