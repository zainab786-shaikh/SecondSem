            <b>ABOUT:</b><br>
            Foundation is a science fiction novel by American writer Isaac Asimov. It is the first published in his
            Foundation
            Trilogy (later expanded into the Foundation series). Foundation is a cycle of five interrelated short
            stories,
            first<br>
            published as a single book by Gnome Press in 1951. Collectively they tell the early story of the Foundation,
            an
            institute founded by psychohistorian Hari Seldon to preserve the best of galactic civilization after the
            collapse of the
            Galactic Empire.
            <br><br>

            <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
            Gaal Dornick travels to the Galactic Empire's capital, Trantor, to take a job with his hero, Hari Seldon.
            When
            the two
            meet, Seldon uses a branch of mathematics called psychohistory to prove that the Galactic Empire will fall
            in
            three
            centuries, ushering in a galaxy-wide Dark Age.<br><br>
            The book ending tells us: "In all human history, no other intelligence has impinged on us, to our knowledge.
            This need
            only continue a few more centuries, perhaps a little more than one ten thousandth of the time civilization
            has
            already
            existed, and we will be safe.
