			<b>ABOUT:</b><br>
			Ringworld tells the story of Louis Wu and his companions on a mission to the Ringworld, a rotating wheel
			artificial world, an alien
			construct in space 186 million miles (299 million kilometres) in diameter.
			<br><br><b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
			The Ringworld is an artificial ring about one million miles wide and approximately the diameter of Earth's
			orbit
			(which makes it about 600 million miles in circumference), encircling a Sol-type star.
			It rotates, providing an artificial gravity equivalent to 99.2% of Earth's gravity by way of centrifugal
			force.

				heard
				that it was a big influence on those. I gotta say that I’d have liked it more if

				the
				trade war minutia of Episodes 1-3 of Star Wars. In non-geeky terms, not very interesting.</td>

			<td><b>Apatt</b><br> <br>Ringworld is definitely a sci-fi classic, a monumental achievement in world
				building. Any sci-fi aficionados who don’t like it should be ashamed of themselves.</td>
