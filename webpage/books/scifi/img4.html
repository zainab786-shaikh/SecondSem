            <b>ABOUT:</b><br>
            Children of Time is a 2015 science fiction novel by author Adrian Tchaikovsky.
            <br>
            The work was praised by the Financial Times for "tackling big themes—gods, messiahs, artificial
            intelligence,
            alienness—with brio."
            <br>
            It was selected from a shortlist of six works and a total pool of 113 books to be awarded the Arthur C.
            Clarke
            Award
            for best science fiction of the year in August 2016.The director of the award program said that the novel
            has a
            "universal scale and sense of wonder reminiscent of Clarke himself."
            <br><br>

            <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
            In a far-future, Dr. Avrana Kern is the head of a science team that has terraformed an uninhabitable planet
            and
            deliberately released a genetically designed virus to speed the evolution of monkeys. Their plan goes wrong
            when
            civil
            war breaks out among humanity and the monkeys' ship burns up upon entry, leaving the virus to infect a
            variety
            of
            unintended creatures, including spiders (Portia labiata). <br>Meanwhile, the last human remnants of a dying
            Earth are en
            route to the promised paradise planet unaware of the uplifted spiders.The work plays off the contrast
            between
            the rapid advancement of the spiders and the barbaric descent of the starship crew of the last humans.
