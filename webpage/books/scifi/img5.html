        Snow Crash is a science fiction novel by the American writer Neal Stephenson, published in 1992. Like many of

        science,
        politics, cryptography, memetics, and philosophy.<br>
        Stephenson originally planned Snow Crash as a computer-generated graphic novel in collaboration with artist Tony
        Sheeder.Snow Crash was nominated for both the British Science Fiction Award in 1993 and the Arthur C. Clarke
        Award in 1994.

        <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
        The story opens in Los Angeles in the 21st century, an unspecified number of years after a worldwide economic
        collapse.
        Los Angeles is no longer part of the United States since the federal government has ceded most of its power and
        territory to private organizations and entrepreneurs.Franchising, individual sovereignty, and private vehicles
        reign
        supreme. Mercenary armies compete for national defense contracts, while private security guards preserve the
        peace in
        sovereign gated housing developments. Highway companies compete to attract drivers to their
        roads, and
        all mail delivery is by hired courier. The remnants of government maintain authority only in isolated
        compounds, where they do tedious make-work that is, by and large, irrelevant to the society around
        them.<br> Much
        of the world's territory has been carved up into sovereign enclaves known as Franchise-Organized Quasi-National
        Entities
        (FOQNEs), each run by its own big business franchise (such as "Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong", or the
        corporatized
        American Mafia), or various residential burbclaves (quasi-sovereign gated communities). In this future, American
        institutions are far different from those in the actual United States at the time the book was published; for
        example, a
        for-profit organization, the CIC, has evolved from the CIA's merger with the Library of Congress.
