		<b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
	<p>
		"The Martian" is a science fiction novel by Andy Weir, published in 2011. The book follows the story of Mark
		Watney, an astronaut who is accidentally left behind on Mars after his crewmates believe him to be dead during
		an emergency evacuation.
		<br><br>
		The novel is structured as a series of log entries written by Watney, detailing his efforts to survive on the
		barren planet with limited resources. Through his entries, readers learn about Watney's scientific knowledge and
		problem-solving skills as he figures out how to produce food, generate water, and communicate with Earth.
		<br><br>
		Watney is a botanist and engineer, which proves invaluable in his efforts to stay alive. He uses his knowledge
		to grow potatoes in Martian soil, using feces as fertilizer, and to generate water through a chemical reaction
		involving hydrogen and oxygen. He also has to deal with various challenges, such as a solar panel malfunction, a
		communication blackout, and a long journey across the planet to reach a rescue mission.
		<br><br>
		Meanwhile, back on Earth, NASA discovers that Watney is alive and sets out on a mission to rescue him. They face
		many obstacles along the way, such as a launch window that requires precise timing, and the need to find a way
		to resupply Watney with food and water during his long wait for rescue.
		<br><br>
		The story is not just about Watney's struggle to survive, but also about the collaboration and dedication of the
		people on Earth working to bring him home. The book portrays the NASA team as highly competent and motivated,
		working tirelessly to bring Watney back to Earth.
		<br><br>
		In the end, Watney's rescue is successful, and he returns to Earth as a hero. The novel ends with Watney
		reflecting on his experience, grateful for the support he received from the people on Earth and proud of his own
		resilience and determination.
		<br><br>
		Overall, "The Martian" is a gripping and entertaining novel that combines scientific accuracy with a compelling
		story of survival and teamwork. It has been praised for its humor, its attention to detail, and its portrayal of
		the human spirit in the face of adversity.
