            <b>ABOUT:</b><br>
            Dune is a 1965 epic science fiction novel by American author Frank Herbert, originally published as two
            separate
            serials
            in Analog magazine. It tied with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo Award in 1966 and it won the
            inaugural
            Nebula Award for Best Novel. It is the first installment of the Dune saga.
            <br><br>

            <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
            Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the
            mysterious
            man known
            as Muad'Dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family -- and would bring to fruition
            humankind's
            most ancient and unattainable dream.
