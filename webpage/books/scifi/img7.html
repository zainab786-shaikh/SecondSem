		<b>Authors:</b> <i> Kim Stanley Robinson<br></i> <br><b>Date of publish:</b> <i> September 1992</i><br><br>
		<b>ABOUT:</b><br>
		"Red Mars" is a purely fictional novel and never claims to have any scientific warrant.Red Mars starts in 2026
		with the first colonial voyage to Mars aboard
		the Ares, the largest interplanetary spacecraft ever built and home to a crew who are to be the first hundred
		Martian colonists.
		<br><br><b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
		Red Mars is the first novel of the Mars trilogy, published to great acclaim in 1992. It tells of the beginnings
		of the colonization of Mars, the beginnings of the
		efforts to terraform it and the tensions resulting from corporate forces from Earth exerting their influence on
		the developing Martian culture.Despite the imposing
		density of the narrative, a novel of splendid characters in a brilliantly realized and utterly convincing
		setting. A pity about the overfamiliar colonization- exploitation-revolution
		plot cycle; still, for power, scope, depth, and detail, no other Martian epic comes close.

			<td><b>Andrew</b><br><br>I am on my third reading of this book! It is unusual in that although it is science
				fiction, it centers on human reactions and relationships, and conflict between opposing thoughts on
				terraforming. The characters seem very real to me.</td>
