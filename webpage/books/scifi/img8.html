			<b>ABOUT:</b><br>
			The novel tells the story of a young boy, Ender Wiggin, who is sent to a training academy named Battle
			School,
			located in orbit above the Earth,
			built to train people to become soldiers that will one day battle against a vast alien race known as
			"Buggers
			<br><br><b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
			The two major conflicts are internal, being that of how Ender was mentally broken down, and external,being
			that
			of the “Bugger” Human war. Both of the conflicts make Ender
			question himself morally. There are many key figures that contributed in the conflict whether it sets the
			conflict or helps end it .Through all four endings, Ender defeats or overcomes
			his old enemies: he defeats the adults by escaping to a new world, defeats the other kids by reconnecting
			with
			his sister, overcomes the buggers by realizing they're not enemies (which is a kind of defeat),
			and he defeats his brother by finally making peace with him.
