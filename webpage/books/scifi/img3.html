        <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
        Jamie Gray goes to a six-month performance review as an employee for food delivery startup füdmüd expecting to
        impress
        boss Rob Sanders with plans to grow the company, only to be terminated and offered a delivery contract instead.
        At first
        rejecting the offer, Jamie is eventually forced to take it after all to make rent, as jobs are scarce in
        COVID-19-afflicted New York City. One delivery client turns out to be Tom Stevens, an old acquaintance, and over
        the
        next few weeks of deliveries they renew their friendship.<br>Tom has a lucrative position with KPS, a secretive
        animal
        rights NGO, and is slated to head out into the field right about the same time Jamie loses the delivery job
        (füdmüd
        having been bought out). Tom offers Jamie a job with his own employer, and Jamie, again out of options, goes in
        for the
        interview, is accepted, and is soon on a plane to Thule Air Base in Greenland.
