		<b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
	<p>
		"Doomsday Book" is a science fiction novel by Connie Willis, first published in 1992. The book is set in two
		time periods: the 21st century and the 14th century during the time of the Black Death. The novel explores the
		themes of time travel, history, and the human experience in the face of mortality.
		<br><br>
		In the novel, a historian named Kivrin Engle is sent back in time from the 21st century to the 14th century to
		study the period firsthand. Kivrin is sent back to a village called Iffley, near Oxford, England, and is meant
		to stay for only a few weeks. However, due to a series of technical malfunctions, she becomes trapped in the
		past, unable to return to her own time.
		<br><br>
		Meanwhile, back in the 21st century, a new strain of the flu has broken out, and the lab where Kivrin was sent
		from is placed under quarantine. As Kivrin struggles to survive in the past, her colleagues in the future race
		to find a way to bring her back and cure the flu epidemic.
		<br><br>
		In the 14th century, Kivrin is forced to confront the grim reality of life during the Black Death. She sees
		firsthand the devastating effects of the disease on the villagers and experiences the fear and superstition that
		pervade the time. Despite her initial enthusiasm for her mission, Kivrin begins to question the value of her
		work in the face of so much suffering and death.
		<br><br>
		As Kivrin struggles to survive and her colleagues in the future work to rescue her, the novel explores themes of
		mortality, faith, and the human experience in the face of disaster. The novel also raises questions about the
		ethics of time travel and the responsibilities of historians to the people they study.
		<br><br>
		In the end, Kivrin is rescued and returns to the 21st century, but she is forever changed by her experience in
		the past. The novel ends with Kivrin reflecting on the lessons she has learned and the ways in which her
		experience has shaped her understanding of history and the human condition.
		<br><br>
		Overall, "Doomsday Book" is a moving and thought-provoking novel that blends science fiction with historical
		fiction to explore deep themes of mortality and the human experience. It has won several prestigious awards,
