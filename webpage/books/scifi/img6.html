			1961</i><br><br>
		<b>ABOUT:</b><br>
		The War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells is about a fictional invasion of Southern England by Martians. The military
		is powerless against the Martians'
		superior weapons, and many people die. The Martians are eventually killed by bacterial infection.
		<br><br><b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
		The major external conflict of the plot is the humans' fight to protect themselves and Earth from the invading
		Martians. At the conflict's core, the
		Narrator, who gives voice to this human experience, wants to survive the Martians' invasion, and the Martians
		want to take over Earth.<br><br>
		He discovers that the Martians have all died from bacteria, as they had none on their home world. People flood
		back into the city, and the Narrator
		is nursed back to health by a helpful family. He hears that Leatherhead was destroyed. He leaves the family,
		returns to his home in Woking, and finds his wife.
