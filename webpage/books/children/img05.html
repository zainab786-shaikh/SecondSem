		<b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
	<p>
		Charlotte's Web is a classic children's book written by E.B. White and published in 1952. It tells the story
		of
		a young pig named Wilbur who is saved from being slaughtered by a spider named Charlotte. The book explores
		themes of friendship, loyalty, and the cycle of life and death.
		<br><br>
		The story begins on the Zuckerman farm where Wilbur is born. He is the runt of the litter and is very small
		and
		weak. Fern, the farmer's daughter, convinces her father to let her keep Wilbur as a pet. Fern takes care of
		Wilbur, but as he grows bigger, she realizes that he will soon be sold to the butcher. She decides to save
		him
		by finding him a new home.
		<br><br>
		Wilbur is eventually taken to the barn of the neighboring farm, where he meets a variety of animals
		including a
		wise old spider named Charlotte. Wilbur quickly makes friends with the other animals, but he is still
		worried
		about his fate. Charlotte promises to help him and comes up with a plan to save his life.
		<br><br>
		Charlotte begins spinning webs in the barn with words written in them, such as "Some Pig," "Terrific," and
		"Radiant." The other animals are amazed by Charlotte's ability to write, and soon the news of Wilbur's
		amazing
		qualities spreads throughout the countryside. As a result, Wilbur becomes famous and is no longer in danger
		of
		being slaughtered.
		<br><br>
		However, as time passes, Charlotte begins to weaken and eventually dies, leaving Wilbur heartbroken. Before
		she
		dies, she lays an egg sac containing hundreds of baby spiders. Wilbur promises to take care of them and keep
		Charlotte's memory alive.
		<br><br>
		The story ends with Wilbur winning a prize at the county fair and returning to the Zuckerman farm where he
		lives
		out the rest of his days with his new spider friends. The book concludes with the famous line, "It is not
		often
		that someone comes along who is a true friend and a good writer. Charlotte was both."
