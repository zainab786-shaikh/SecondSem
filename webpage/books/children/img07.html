		<b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
	<p>
		"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" is a novel written by Lewis Carroll and first published in 1865. The book
		tells the story of a young girl named Alice, who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world of talking
		animals, magic, and nonsense.
		<br><br>
		Alice begins her adventure by chasing a talking White Rabbit, who leads her to a rabbit hole. She falls down the
		hole and lands in a strange room with doors that are too small for her to fit through. She drinks a potion that
		makes her shrink and then eats a cake that makes her grow, which allows her to finally pass through the door.
		<br><br>
		Alice meets many strange creatures on her journey, including a hookah-smoking Caterpillar, a grinning Cheshire
		Cat, and a Mad Hatter who is perpetually stuck at tea-time. She attends a chaotic trial presided over by the
		Queen of Hearts, who orders her beheading for a crime she didn't commit.
		<br><br>
		Throughout her adventures, Alice is continually frustrated by the bizarre logic of Wonderland, which defies all
		reason and common sense. The story is filled with puns, jokes, and wordplay, which add to the nonsensical nature
		of the story.
		<br><br>
		Alice eventually wakes up from her dream, realizing that her adventure was just a figment of her imagination.
		However, the story ends with the suggestion that her experiences in Wonderland may not have been entirely
		imaginary.
		<br><br>
		The novel has become a classic of English literature, known for its imaginative world-building and clever
		wordplay. It has been adapted into numerous films, plays, and other forms of media, and its influence can be
		seen in many works of fantasy and children's literature that have followed it.
