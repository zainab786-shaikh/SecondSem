		<b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
	<p>
		"A Wrinkle in Time" is a science fiction novel written by Madeleine L'Engle and published in 1962. The book
		tells the story of a young girl named Meg Murry and her quest to rescue her father from the clutches of evil
		forces.
		<br><br>
		The story begins with Meg, a thirteen-year-old girl who is struggling in school and dealing with the
		disappearance of her father, a scientist who has been missing for several years. Meg's mother and her three
		brothers, Charles Wallace, Sandy, and Dennys, are all worried about her and try to support her in their own
		ways. However, Meg feels like she doesn't fit in and is plagued by feelings of inadequacy.
		<br><br>
		One stormy night, Meg and Charles Wallace are visited by a strange old woman named Mrs. Whatsit, who reveals
		that there is a way to travel through time and space using a concept called a tesseract. She tells them that
		Meg's father is being held captive on a planet called Camazotz by a being known as the Black Thing. Meg,
		Charles
		Wallace, and their friend Calvin O'Keefe embark on a dangerous journey to rescue Mr. Murry and save the
		universe
		from the Black Thing's evil influence.
		<br><br>
		The three children are guided on their journey by Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which, who are revealed
		to be
		celestial beings with extraordinary powers. Along the way, they encounter various challenges and obstacles,
		including a planet where everyone is forced to conform to a strict set of rules, a dark forest inhabited by
		evil
		creatures, and a planet where the inhabitants are disembodied brains controlled by a powerful brain known as
		IT.
		<br><br>
		As the children face these challenges, they learn important lessons about love, sacrifice, and the power of
		the
		individual. They also learn that the universe is a vast and mysterious place, and that there are forces at
		work
		that are beyond human comprehension.
		<br><br>
		In the end, Meg and her friends are able to rescue Meg's father and defeat the Black Thing. Meg learns that
		her
		own faults and imperfections are what make her unique and special, and that she has the power to change the
		world in her own way.
		<br><br>
		"A Wrinkle in Time" is a classic novel that explores themes of individuality, conformity, and the power of
		love.
		It is a timeless story that has captivated readers for generations, and continues to be a beloved work of
		science fiction and fantasy.
