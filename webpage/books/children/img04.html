		children in the village, who begin to tease and bully her. Desperate to get rid of the necklace, Binya decides
		to trade it for something else. One day, she comes across a blue umbrella that belongs to a shopkeeper in the
		village, Ram Bharosa. Binya is captivated by the beauty of the umbrella and is determined to have it. She
