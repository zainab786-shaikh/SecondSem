			<b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
			<div>
				"The BFG" is a beloved children's book written by Roald Dahl and published in 1982. The story follows a
				young
				orphan girl named Sophie, who is snatched from her bed by a giant in the middle of the night. However,
				she
				quickly realizes that her captor, the BFG (short for "Big Friendly Giant"), is not like the other giants
				who
				roam the countryside and terrorize humans. Instead, the BFG is kind-hearted and spends his time catching
				dreams
				and blowing them into the bedrooms of sleeping children.
				<br><br>
				Sophie is at first frightened of the BFG, but soon realizes that he is not like the other giants. The
				BFG
				tells
				Sophie about his life and how he is bullied by the other giants because he refuses to eat
				humans like they do. The other giants are cruel and selfish, and they spend their days snacking on
				"human
				beans"
				and causing chaos. The BFG, on the other hand, is gentle and wise, and he takes Sophie under his wing.
				<br><br>
				Together, Sophie and the BFG hatch a plan to stop the other giants from causing harm. They decide to
				visit
				the
				Queen of England and ask for her help. With the BFG's knowledge of dreams and his ability to transport
				people
				with his magical powers, they travel to Buckingham Palace and meet the Queen.
				<br><br>
				Initially skeptical, the Queen is eventually convinced by Sophie and the BFG's story and agrees to help
				them.
				With the help of the Royal Air Force, they devise a plan to trap the other giants and prevent them from
				harming
				anyone else. The BFG uses his powers to catch the other giants and transport them to a far-off island
				where
				they
				can't harm anyone.
				<br><br>
				In the end, Sophie is hailed as a hero for her bravery in helping to save the world from the other
				giants.
				The
				BFG is also celebrated for his kindness and his willingness to do what's right, even in the face of
				adversity.
				The book ends with Sophie and the BFG returning to their home and living happily ever after.
				<br><br>
				Overall, "The BFG" is a heartwarming story about the power of friendship, bravery, and standing up for
				what
				is
				right. Roald Dahl's signature wit and humor are on full display in this classic children's tale that
				continues
				to captivate readers of all ages.
