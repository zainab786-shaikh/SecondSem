    with his former love interest, Lina Bowen. The novel explores themes such as the search for happiness and
    fulfillment, the complexities of love and relationships, and the clash between American and European cultures.
    Howells' writing style is known for its realism and attention to detail, and the book is considered a classic of

    "Indian summer" is likely a metaphor for the unexpected warmth and passion that Theodore and Lina experience
    during
