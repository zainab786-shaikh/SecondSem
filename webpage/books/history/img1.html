    <b> ABOUT:</b>The book is based on a wide range of primary sources, including Bahadur Shah Zafar's own writings and
    letters, as well
    as official records from the British East India Company. Dalrymple also draws on the accounts of contemporary
    British and Indian
    eyewitnesses to the events.<br><br>
    <b> SUMMARY:</b>"The Last Mughal: The Fall of a Dynasty, Delhi, 1857" is a historical non-fiction book by William
    Dalrymple that tells the story of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the fall of the Mughal Empire in India. The book
    focuses on the life
    of the last Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, and his role in the rebellion.
    Dalrymple draws on a wide range of primary sources to provide a detailed and vivid account of life in Delhi before,
    during, and after the rebellion. He explores the complex relationships between the Mughal court, the British
    colonial authorities, and the Indian people, as well as the cultural and religious tensions that led to the
    rebellion.
    "The Last Mughal" is a well-researched and engaging account of a pivotal moment in Indian history, shedding new
    light on the complex interactions between India and Britain during the colonial period, and the lasting impact of
    the events of 1857 on Indian society and politics.<br>
