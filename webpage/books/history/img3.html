  <b>SUMMARY: </b>"An Era of Darkness: The British Empire in India" by Shashi Tharoor is a comprehensive and critical analysis of British colonial rule in India. Tharoor argues that the British Empire was not a force for good in India, but rather a ruthless exploitation of a nation and its people tha
t caused immense suffering and damage.
The book covers various aspects of British colonialism in India, including the economic impact, the suppression of Indian industry and trade, the destruction of Indian agriculture, the exploitation of Indian labor, the imposition of British culture and values, and the erosion of Indian identity and self-esteem.
 Tharoor also examines the role of Indian elites in collaborating with the British and the origins of the Indian nationalist movement.
Overall, "An Era of Darkness" is a passionate and eloquent defense of India's right to self-determination and dignity, and a powerful indictment of British colonialism in India.
